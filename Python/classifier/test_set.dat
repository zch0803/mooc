S"Senescence-associated lncRNAs: senescence-associated long noncoding RNAs.\r\nNoncoding RNAs include small transcripts, such as microRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs, and a wide range of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although many lncRNAs have been identified, only a small number of lncRNAs have been characterized functionally. Here, we sought to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed during replicative senescence. We compared lncRNAs expressed in proliferating, early-passage, 'young' human diploid WI-38 fibroblasts [population doubling (PDL) 20] with those expressed in senescent, late-passage, 'old' fibroblasts (PDL 52) by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Numerous transcripts in all lncRNA groups (antisense lncRNAs, pseudogene-encoded lncRNAs, previously described lncRNAs and novel lncRNAs) were validated using reverse transcription (RT) and real-time, quantitative (q)PCR. Among the novel senescence-associated lncRNAs (SAL-RNAs) showing lower abundance in senescent cells, SAL-RNA1 (XLOC_023166) was found to delay senescence, because reducing SAL-RNA1 levels enhanced the appearance of phenotypic traits of senescence, including an enlarged morphology, positive \xce\xb2-galactosidase activity, and heightened p53 levels. Our results reveal that the expression of known and novel lncRNAs changes with senescence and suggests that SAL-RNAs play direct regulatory roles in this important cellular process."

aS'Clinical significance of high expression of circulating serum lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 in breast cancer patients: a Chinese population-based study.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been gradually confirmed to be tumor-associated biological molecules and became interesting new diagnostic targets of cancer. However, the clinical significances of most cancer-related lncRNAs are largely unknown. Here, we evaluated, for the first time, the feasibility and clinical significances of circulating serum lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 as biomarker for the detection of breast cancer (BC). In this study, the relative concentrations of breast cancer-associated lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 were investigated in a total of 136 serum samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The correlations between the levels of serum lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 in breast cancer patients and the clinicopathological factors of these patients were further analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic values. In breast cancer patients, the expression level of lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 is significantly increased (p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). The sensitivity and specificity of RP11-445H22.4 for BC were 92 and 74 %, respectively. Its expression levels were correlated with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and menopausal status of the breast cancer patients (p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). For the detection of breast cancer, the use of RP11-445H22.4 showed a remarkable improvement compared with the clinical serum carcinoembryonic antigen. In conclusions, lncRNA RP11-445H22.4 may be a new potential biomarker of breast cancer.'

aS"Altered microRNA profiles in cerebrospinal fluid exosome in Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.\r\nThe differential diagnosis of Parkinson's diseases (PD) is challenging, especially in the early stages of the disease. We developed a microRNA profiling strategy for exosomal miRNAs isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD and AD. Sixteen exosomal miRNAs were up regulated and 11 miRNAs were under regulated significantly in PD CSF when compared with those in healthy controls (relative fold &gt; 2, p &lt; 0.05). MiR-1 and miR-19b-3p were validated and significantly reduced in independent samples. While miR-153, miR-409-3p, miR-10a-5p, and let-7g-3p were significantly over expressed in PD CSF exosome. Bioinformatic analysis by DIANA-mirPath demonstrated that Neurotrophin signaling, mTOR signaling, Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, Dopaminergic synapse, and Glutamatergic synapse were the most prominent pathways enriched in quantiles with PD miRNA patterns. Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts [amyloid precursor protein (APP), \xce\xb1-synuclein (\xce\xb1-syn), Tau, neurofilament light gene (NF-L), DJ-1/PARK7, Fractalkine and Neurosin] and long non-coding RNAs (RP11-462G22.1 and PCA3) were differentially expressed in CSF exosomes in PD and AD patients. These data demonstrated that CSF exosomal RNA molecules are reliable biomarkers with fair robustness in regard to specificity and sensitivity in differentiating PD from healthy and diseased (AD) controls."

aS'Long non-coding RNAs in colorectal cancer.\r\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Despite substantial progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms and treatment of CRC in recent years, the overall survival rate of CRC patients has not improved dramatically. The development of CRC is multifactor and multistep processes, in which abnormal gene expression may play an important role. With the advance of human tumor molecular biology, a series of studies have highlighted the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of CRC. CRC-related lncRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate the genes by various mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications, lncRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-protein interactions, and by their actions as miRNA precursors or pseudogenes. Since some lncRNAs can be detected in human body fluid and have good specificity and accessibility, they have been suggested to be used as novel potential biomarkers for CRC diagnosis and prognosis as well as in the prediction of the response to therapy. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on lncRNAs in CRC development, the mechanisms and biomarkers of lncRNAs in CRC.'

aS'Discovery of Protein-lncRNA Interactions by Integrating Large-Scale CLIP-Seq and RNA-Seq Datasets.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory molecules in developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. However, the precise mechanism and functions of most of lncRNAs remain largely unknown. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated RNAs after cross-linking (CLIP-Seq) provide powerful ways to identify biologically relevant protein-lncRNA interactions. In this study, by analyzing millions of RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites from 117 CLIP-Seq datasets generated by 50 independent studies, we identified 22,735 RBP-lncRNA regulatory relationships. We found that one single lncRNA will generally be bound and regulated by one or multiple RBPs, the combination of which may coordinately regulate gene expression. We also revealed the expression correlation of these interaction networks by mining expression profiles of over 6000 normal and tumor samples from 14 cancer types. Our combined analysis of CLIP-Seq data and genome-wide association studies data discovered hundreds of disease-related single nucleotide polymorphisms resided in the RBP binding sites of lncRNAs. Finally, we developed interactive web implementations to provide visualization, analysis, and downloading of the aforementioned large-scale datasets. Our study represented an important step in identification and analysis of RBP-lncRNA interactions and showed that these interactions may play crucial roles in cancer and genetic diseases.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA EWSAT1-mediated gene repression facilitates Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis.\r\nChromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma. EWS-FLI1 alters gene expression through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on primary pediatric human mesenchymal progenitor cells (pMPCs) expressing EWS-FLI1 in order to identify gene targets of this oncoprotein. We determined that long noncoding RNA-277 (Ewing sarcoma-associated transcript 1 [EWSAT1]) is upregulated by EWS-FLI1 in pMPCs. Inhibition of EWSAT1 expression diminished the ability of Ewing sarcoma cell lines to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar, whereas EWSAT1 inhibition had no effect on other cell types tested. Expression of EWS-FLI1 and EWSAT1 repressed gene expression, and a substantial fraction of targets that were repressed by EWS-FLI1 were also repressed by EWSAT1. Analysis of RNAseq data from primary human Ewing sarcoma further supported a role for EWSAT1 in mediating gene repression. We identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HNRNPK) as an RNA-binding protein that interacts with EWSAT1 and found a marked overlap in HNRNPK-repressed genes and those repressed by EWS-FLI1 and EWSAT1, suggesting that HNRNPK participates in EWSAT1-mediated gene repression. Together, our data reveal that EWSAT1 is a downstream target of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes.'

aS'Screening for Small-Molecule Modulators of Long Noncoding RNA-Protein Interactions Using AlphaScreen.\r\nLong non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of molecules that help orchestrate key cellular events. Although their functional roles in cells are not well understood, thousands of lncRNAs and a number of possible mechanisms by which they act have been reported. LncRNAs can exert their regulatory function in cells by interacting with epigenetic enzymes. In this study, we developed a tool to study lncRNA-protein interactions for high-throughput screening of small-molecule modulators using AlphaScreen technology. We tested the interaction of two lncRNAs: brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense (BDNF-AS) and Hox transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR), with Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase against a phytochemical library, to look for small-molecule inhibitors that can alter the expression of downstream target genes. We identified ellipticine, a compound that up-regulates BDNF transcription. Our study shows the feasibility of using high-throughput screening to identify modulators of lncRNA-protein interactions and paves the road for targeting lncRNAs that are dysregulated in human disorders using small-molecule therapies.'

aS'A new technique of ureteric catheterization.\r\nInsertion of an indwelling stent catheter or ureteric catheterization using a new guide wire (the Radiofocus guide wire) was carried out in a total of 24 subjects. The subjects comprised 16 patients in whom insertion of a conventional guide wire and ureteric catheter was not possible due to previous use of an indwelling stent catheter for extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), 2 cases in whom a conventional guide wire could not be inserted due to post-ESWL formation of a stone street, 4 patients with ureteric stenosis and 2 patients with normal ureters in whom catheterization was impossible by the usual methods. Insertion of a Radifocus guide wire into the renal pelvis was successfully accomplished in all 24 cases and an indwelling catheter could be passed in 21 cases. These results suggest that the Radifocus guide wire should make a useful contribution to ESWL therapy. It can also be applied to retrograde pyelography, ureteric obstruction, and the dilation of ureteric stenosis.'

aS'Hypoxic regulation of the noncoding genome and NEAT1.\r\nActivation of hypoxia pathways is both associated with and contributes to an aggressive phenotype across multiple types of solid cancers. The regulation of gene transcription by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a key element in this response. HIF directly upregulates the expression of many hundreds of protein-coding genes, which act to both improve oxygen delivery and to reduce oxygen demand. However, it is now becoming apparent that many classes of noncoding RNAs are also regulated by hypoxia, with several (e.g. micro RNAs, long noncoding RNAs and antisense RNAs) under direct transcriptional regulation by HIF. These hypoxia-regulated, noncoding RNAs may act as effectors of the indirect response to HIF by acting on specific coding transcripts or by affecting generic RNA-processing pathways. In addition, noncoding RNAs may also act as modulators of the HIF pathway, either by integrating other physiological responses or, in the case of HIF-regulated, noncoding RNAs, by providing negative or positive feedback and feedforward loops that affect upstream or downstream components of the HIF cascade. These hypoxia-regulated, noncoding transcripts play important roles in the aggressive hypoxic phenotype observed in cancer.'

aS"Expression of lncRNA-CCAT1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in colorectal cancer and its clinical significance.\r\nOBJECTIVE: To explore the expression and clinical significance of IncRNA-CCAT and EMT related molecule E-cadherin and N-cadherin in colorectal cancer.METHODS: The expression of IncRNA-CCAT1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in 37 colorectal cancer tissue and para-carcinoma tissue was detected using qRT-PCR method, and the correlation of expression level with clinical and pathological features was studied.RESULTS: The expression of IncRNA-CCAT1 in tumor tissue was significantly higher than that in normal para-carcinoma tissue (P &lt; 0.001), and the expression level of CCAT1was significantly correlated with local infiltration depth (P &lt; 0.001), tumor staging (P &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.001) and CA19-9 level (P &lt; 0.001); but not related with age, gender, location of tumor, tumor differentiation level, size of primary lesion and level of CEA (P &gt; 0.05). The expression of E-cadherin in tumor tissues was significantly lower than in normal para-carcinoma tissues (P &lt; 0.001), and the expression of N-cadherin was significantly higher than that in normal para-carcinoma tissues. The decrease in expression of E-cadherin and increase in expression of N-cadherin were significantly correlated with local infiltration depth (P &lt; 0.001), tumor staging (P &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.001), tumor differentiation level (P &lt; 0.001) and CA19-9 level (P &lt; 0.001), however not related with age, gender, tumor location, size of primary lesion and CEA level (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: CCAT1 plays an important role in the genesis, development, invasion and metastasis; it mediates the EMT process of colorectal cancer; and it's expected to be a new marker and treatment target in colorectal diagnosis and treatment."

aS'Genome-wide identification of polycomb-associated RNAs by RIP-seq.\r\nPolycomb proteins play essential roles in stem cell renewal and human disease. Recent studies of HOX genes and X inactivation have provided evidence for RNA cofactors in Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Here we develop a RIP-seq method to capture the PRC2 transcriptome and identify\xc2\xa0a genome-wide pool of &gt;9000 PRC2-interacting RNAs in embryonic stem cells. The transcriptome includes antisense, intergenic, and promoter-associated transcripts, as well as many unannotated RNAs. A large number of transcripts occur within imprinted regions, oncogene and tumor suppressor loci, and stem cell-related bivalent domains. We provide evidence for direct RNA-protein interactions, most likely via the Ezh2 subunit. We also identify Gtl2 RNA as a PRC2 cofactor that directs PRC2 to the reciprocally imprinted Dlk1 coding gene. Thus, Polycomb proteins interact with a genome-wide family of RNAs, some of which may be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for human disease.'

aS'CEBPA-regulated lncRNAs, new players in the study of acute myeloid leukemia.\r\nCCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\xce\xb1 (CEBPA) is a critical regulator of myeloid differentiation. Disruption of CEBPA function contributes to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CEBPA regulates a large number of protein coding genes of which several were shown to contribute to CEBPA function. In this study, we expand the analysis of CEBPA transcriptional targets to the newly identified class of long non-coding RNAs. We show that lncRNAs are a main component of the transcriptional program driven by C/EBP\xce\xb1 and that many of these are also induced during granulocytic differentiation of AML cell lines supporting their relevance in proliferation arrest and differentiation.'

aS'Human disease-associated genetic variation impacts large intergenic non-coding RNA expression.\r\nRecently it has become clear that only a small percentage (7%) of disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located in protein-coding regions, while the remaining 93% are located in gene regulatory regions or in intergenic regions. Thus, the understanding of how genetic variations control the expression of non-coding RNAs (in a tissue-dependent manner) has far-reaching implications. We tested the association of SNPs with expression levels (eQTLs) of large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), using genome-wide gene expression and genotype data from five different tissues. We identified 112 cis-regulated lincRNAs, of which 45% could be replicated in an independent dataset. We observed that 75% of the SNPs affecting lincRNA expression (lincRNA cis-eQTLs) were specific to lincRNA alone and did not affect the expression of neighboring protein-coding genes. We show that this specific genotype-lincRNA expression correlation is tissue-dependent and that many of these lincRNA cis-eQTL SNPs are also associated with complex traits and diseases.'

aS"Low expression of novel lncRNA RP11-462C24.1 suggests a biomarker of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules, which were involved in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases. Research on lncRNAs may shed light on tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The purpose of the present study was to identify lncRNAs correlated with CRC and then investigate their potential functions. We selected 92 patients for this prospective study and then collected the tumor samples and clinical records. First, the global lncRNA expression profiles in tumor and adjacent normal tissues of patients with non-metastatic CRC and patients with metastatic CRC were measured by microarray assay. Then, a noteworthy lncRNAs RP11-462C24.1 whose function was previously unknown was explored in detail on the aspect of the association of its expression level and clinicopathological features of CRC and patients' survival. We found that RP11-462C24.1 expression level was lower in cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal samples (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, its expression level was lower in CRC patients with metastasis than those without metastasis (P = 0.049). That is, RP11-462C24.1 expression level decreased as the malignant degree of CRC increased. In addition, low expression of RP11-462C24.1 significantly correlated with more distant metastasis (P = 0.011). The areas under ROC curves were 0.78 and 0.65 for RP11-462C24.1, distinguishing CRC from normal tissue and distinguishing CRC without metastasis from CRC with metastasis, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified that RP11-462C24.1 was an independent predictor for patients prognosis (P = 0.005). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with low expression of RP11-462C24.1 had a poor disease-free survival (P &lt; 0.001). This is the first study that correlates RP11-462C24.1 expression profile with malignancy grade in human CRC. Our results showed that RP11-462C24.1 could be a potential novel prognostic marker for CRC, and thus, provided a new strategy for CRC diagnosis. Meanwhile, our findings indicated the potential roles of RP11-462C24.1 in tumorigenesis and progression of CRC, which gave a clue for future studies."

aS'Transcriptional profiling identifies the long noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation (PVT1) as a novel regulator of the asthmatic phenotype in human airway smooth muscle.\r\nBACKGROUND: The mechanism underlying nonsevere and severe asthma remains unclear, although it is commonly associated with increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to be important in regulating healthy primary airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), whereas changed expression has been observed in CD8 T\xc2\xa0cells from patients with severe asthma.METHODS: Primary ASMCs were isolated from healthy subjects (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09) and patients classified as having nonsevere (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09) or severe (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa09) asthma. ASMCs were exposed to dexamethasone and FCS. mRNA and lncRNA expression was measured by using a microarray and quantitative real-time PCR. Bioinformatic analysis was used to examine relevant biological pathways. Finally, the lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) was inhibited by transfection of primary ASMCs with small interfering RNAs, and the effect on ASMC phenotype was examined.RESULTS: The mRNA expression profile was significantly different between patient groups after exposure to dexamethasone and FCS, and these were associated with biological pathways that might be relevant to the pathogenesis of asthma, including cellular proliferation and pathways associated with glucocorticoid activity. We also observed a significant change in lncRNA expression, yet the expression of only one lncRNA (PVT1) is decreased in patients with corticosteroid-sensitive nonsevere asthma and increased in patients with corticosteroid-insensitive severe asthma. Subsequent targeting studies demonstrated the importance of this lncRNA in controlling both proliferation and IL-6 release in ASMCs from patients with severe asthma.CONCLUSIONS: lncRNAs are associated with the aberrant phenotype observed in ASMCs from asthmatic patients. Targeting PVT1 might be effective in reducing airway remodeling in asthmatic patients.'

aS"Protein arginine methyltransferase CARM1 attenuates the paraspeckle-mediated nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus.\r\nIn many cells, mRNAs containing inverted repeated Alu elements (IRAlus) in their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) are inefficiently exported to the cytoplasm. Such nuclear retention correlates with paraspeckle-associated protein complexes containing p54(nrb). However, nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus is variable, and how regulation of retention and export is achieved is poorly understood. Here we show one mechanism of such regulation via the arginine methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1). We demonstrate that disruption of CARM1 enhances the nuclear retention of mRNAs containing IRAlus. CARM1 regulates this nuclear retention pathway at two levels: CARM1 methylates the coiled-coil domain of p54(nrb), resulting in reduced binding of p54(nrb) to mRNAs containing IRAlus, and also acts as a transcription regulator to suppress NEAT1 transcription, leading to reduced paraspeckle formation. These actions of CARM1 work together synergistically to regulate the export of transcripts containing IRAlus from paraspeckles under certain cellular stresses, such as poly(I:C) treatment. This work demonstrates how a post-translational modification of an RNA-binding protein affects protein-RNA interaction and also uncovers a mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the long noncoding RNA NEAT1."

aS'Noncoding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 promote cell proliferation in nonsmall cell lung cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major cause of cancer death worldwide. Increasing evidence shows that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are widely involved in the development and progression of NSCLC. ncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) has not been studied in cancer, especially its role in lung cancer remains unknown. Our studies were designed to investigate the expression and biological significance of SNHG1 in lung cancer. SNHG1 may be a novel ncRNA in early diagnosis in lung cancer.METHODS: Noncoding RNA SNHG1 expression in 7 lung cancer cell lines was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RNA interference approaches were used to find the biological functions of SNHG1. The effect of SNHG1 on proliferation was evaluated by cell count and crystal violet stains.RESULTS: Noncoding RNA SNHG1 expression was significantly upregulated in lung cancer cells when compared with normal bronchial epithelial cells. In addition, in vitro assays our results indicated that knockdown of SNHG1 inhibited cell proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that ncRNA SNHG1 is significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines and may represent a new biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC intervention.'

aS'Combined identification of long non-coding RNA XIST and HIF1A-AS1 in serum as an effective screening for non-small cell lung cancer.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) XIST and HIF1A-AS1 have been shown to play important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and lncRNA-XIST and HIF1A-AS1 are upregulated in several cancers such as glioblastoma, breast cancer and thoracoabdominal aorta aneurysm, however, its value in the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of serum XIST and HIF1A-AS1 as a biomarker in the screening of NSCLC.METHODS: Expression levels of lncRNA-XIST and HIF1A-AS1 in tumor tissues and serum from NSCLC patients were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, and its association with overall survival of patients was analyzed by statistical analysis. Moreover, the XIST and lncRNA-XIST expression correlation between tumor tissues and plasma was demonstrated by linear regression analysis.RESULTS: The levels of XIST (P &lt; 0.05) and HIF1A-AS1 (P &lt; 0.05) were significantly increased in tumor tissues or serum from NSCLC patients as compared to those of control group. Correlation of lncRNA-XIST or HIF1A-AS1 expression between tumor tissues and serum from the same individuals was confirmed in NSCLC patients. Moreover, serum levels of XIST and HIF1A-AS1 were significantly decreased after surgical treatment as compared to pre-operative. The ROC curves illustrated strong separation between the NSCLC patients and control group, with an AUC of 0.834 (95% CI: 0.726-0.935; P &lt; 0.001) for XIST and 0.876 (95% CI: 0.793-0.965; P &lt; 0.001) for HIF1A-AS1, however, the combination of XIST and HIF1A-AS1 yielded an AUC of 0.931 (95% CI: 0.869-0.990; P &lt; 0.001), which was significantly improved as compared to XIST or HIF1A-AS1 alone.CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that increased serum XIST and HIF1A-AS1 could be used as a predictive biomarker for NSCLC screening, and that combination of XIST and HIF1A-AS1 had a higher positive diagnostic efficiency of NSCLC than XIST or HIF1A-AS1 alone.'

aS'High expression of long intervening non-coding RNA OLMALINC in the human cortical white matter is associated with regulation of oligodendrocyte maturation.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a recently discovered subclass of non-coding RNAs. LincRNAs are expressed across the mammalian genome and contribute to the pervasive transcription phenomenon. They display a tissue-specific and species-specific mode of expression and are present abundantly in the brain.RESULTS: Here, we report the expression patterns of oligodendrocyte maturation-associated long intervening non-coding RNA (OLMALINC), which is highly expressed in the white matter (WM) of the human frontal cortex compared to the grey matter (GM) and peripheral tissues. Moreover, we identified a novel isoform of OLMALINC that was also up-regulated in the WM. RNA-interference (RNAi) knockdown of OLMALINC in oligodendrocytes, which are the major cell type in the WM, caused significant changes in the expression of genes regulating cytostructure, cell activation and membrane signaling. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that over 10% of the top 25 up- and down-regulated genes were involved in oligodendrocyte maturation. RNAi experiments in neuronal cells resulted in the perturbation of genes controlling cell proliferation. Furthermore, we identified a novel cis-natural antisense non-coding RNA, which we named OLMALINC-AS, which maps to the first exon of the dominant isoform of OLMALINC.CONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated for the first time that a primate-specific lincRNA regulates the expression of genes critical to human oligodendrocyte maturation, which in turn might be regulated by an antisense counterpart.'

aS'Long Noncoding RNA H19 Promotes Osteoblast Differentiation Via TGF-\xce\xb21/Smad3/HDAC Signaling Pathway by Deriving miR-675.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory molecules at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and may play essential roles in the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC). However, their roles and functions remain unclear. Here, we showed that lncRNA H19 was significantly upregulated after the induction of osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of H19 promoted osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs in vitro and enhanced heterotopic bone formation in vivo, whereas knockdown of H19 inhibited these effects. Subsequently, we found that miR-675, encoded by exon1 of H19, promoted osteoblast differentiation of hMSCs and was partially responsible for the pro-osteogenic effect of H19. Investigating the underlying mechanism, we demonstrated that H19/miR-675 inhibited mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor-\xce\xb21 (TGF-\xce\xb21). The downregulation of TGF-\xce\xb21 subsequently inhibited phosphorylation of Smad3. Meanwhile, H19/miR-675 downregulated the mRNA and protein levels of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4/5, and thus increased osteoblast marker gene expression. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the novel pathway H19/miR-675/TGF-\xce\xb21/Smad3/HDAC regulates osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs and may serve as a potential target for enhancing bone formation in vivo.'

aS'MYCNOS functions as an antisense RNA regulating MYCN.\r\nAmplification or overexpression of neuronal MYC (MYCN) is associated with poor prognosis of human neuroblastoma. Three isoforms of the MYCN protein have been described as well as a protein encoded by an antisense transcript (MYCNOS) that originates from the opposite strand at the MYCN locus. Recent findings suggest that some antisense long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can play a role in epigenetically regulating gene expression. Here we report that MYCNOS transcripts function as a modulator of the MYCN locus, affecting MYCN promoter usage and recruiting various proteins, including the Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein G3BP1, to the upstream MYCN promoter. Overexpression of MYCNOS results in a reduction of upstream MYCN promoter usage and increased MYCN expression, suggesting that the protein-coding MYCNOS also functions as a regulator of MYCN ultimately controlling MYCN transcriptional variants. The observations presented here demonstrate that protein-coding transcripts can regulate gene transcription and can tether regulatory proteins to target loci.'

aS"Systematic transcriptome wide analysis of lncRNA-miRNA interactions.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a recently discovered class of non-protein coding RNAs, which have now increasingly been shown to be involved in a wide variety of biological processes as regulatory molecules. The functional role of many of the members of this class has been an enigma, except a few of them like Malat and HOTAIR. Little is known regarding the regulatory interactions between noncoding RNA classes. Recent reports have suggested that lncRNAs could potentially interact with other classes of non-coding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and modulate their regulatory role through interactions. We hypothesized that lncRNAs could participate as a layer of regulatory interactions with miRNAs. The availability of genome-scale datasets for Argonaute targets across human transcriptome has prompted us to reconstruct a genome-scale network of interactions between miRNAs and lncRNAs.RESULTS: We used well characterized experimental Photoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) datasets and the recent genome-wide annotations for lncRNAs in public domain to construct a comprehensive transcriptome-wide map of miRNA regulatory elements. Comparative analysis revealed that in addition to targeting protein-coding transcripts, miRNAs could also potentially target lncRNAs, thus participating in a novel layer of regulatory interactions between noncoding RNA classes. Furthermore, we have modeled one example of miRNA-lncRNA interaction using a zebrafish model. We have also found that the miRNA regulatory elements have a positional preference, clustering towards the mid regions and 3' ends of the long noncoding transcripts. We also further reconstruct a genome-wide map of miRNA interactions with lncRNAs as well as messenger RNAs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests widespread regulatory interactions between noncoding RNAs classes and suggests a novel functional role for lncRNAs. We also present the first transcriptome scale study on miRNA-lncRNA interactions and the first report of a genome-scale reconstruction of a noncoding RNA regulatory interactome involving lncRNAs."

aS"Transcriptomics Profiling of Alzheimer's Disease Reveal Neurovascular Defects, Altered Amyloid-\xce\xb2 Homeostasis, and Deregulated Expression of Long Noncoding RNAs.\r\nThe underlying genetic variations of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases remain largely unknown. A combination of genetic variations with variable penetrance and lifetime epigenetic factors may converge on transcriptomic alterations that drive LOAD pathological process. Transcriptome profiling using deep sequencing technology offers insight into common altered pathways regardless of underpinning genetic or epigenetic factors and thus represents an ideal tool to investigate molecular mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of LOAD. We performed directional RNA sequencing on high quality RNA samples extracted from hippocampi of LOAD and age-matched controls. We further validated our data using qRT-PCR on a larger set of postmortem brain tissues, confirming downregulation of the gene encoding substance P (TAC1) and upregulation of the gene encoding the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1). Pathway analysis indicates dysregulation in neural communication, cerebral vasculature, and amyloid-\xce\xb2 clearance. Beside protein coding genes, we identified several annotated and non-annotated long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in LOAD brain tissues, three of them are activity-dependent regulated and one is induced by A\xce\xb2(1-42) exposure of human neural cells. Our data provide a comprehensive list of transcriptomics alterations in LOAD hippocampi and warrant holistic approach including both coding and non-coding RNAs in functional studies aimed to understand the pathophysiology of LOAD."

aS'Understanding the Complex Circuitry of lncRNAs at the X-inactivation Center and Its Implications in Disease Conditions.\r\nBalanced gene expression is a high priority in order to maintain optimal functioning since alterations and variations could result in acute consequences. X chromosome inactivation (X-inactivation) is one such strategy utilized by mammalian species to silence the extra X chromosome in females to uphold a similar level of expression between the two sexes. A functionally versatile class of molecules called long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) has emerged as key regulators of gene expression and plays important roles during development. An lncRNA that is indispensable for X-inactivation is X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), which induces a repressive epigenetic landscape and creates the inactive X chromosome (Xi). With recent advents in the field of X-inactivation, novel positive and negative lncRNA regulators of Xist such as Jpx and Tsix, respectively, have broadened the regulatory network of X-inactivation. Xist expression failure or dysregulation has been implicated in producing developmental anomalies and disease states. Subsequently, reactivation of the Xi at a later stage of development has also been associated with certain tumors. With the recent influx of information about lncRNA biology and advancements in methods to probe lncRNA, we can now attempt to understand this complex network of Xist regulation in development and disease. It has become clear that the presence of an extra set of genes could be fatal for the organism. Only by understanding the precise ways in which lncRNAs function can treatments be developed to bring aberrations under control. This chapter summarizes our current understanding and knowledge with regard to how lncRNAs are orchestrated at the X-inactivation center (Xic), with a special focus on how genetic diseases come about as a consequence of lncRNA dysregulation.'

aS'Fentanyl inhibits the invasion and migration of colorectal cancer cells via inhibiting the negative regulation of Ets-1 on BANCR.\r\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown the potential anti-tumor effect of fentanyl on colorectal cancer (CRC). However, its underling mechanism is still unclear. Since studies indicates the abnormal expression of transcription factor Ets-1 and BRAF-activated lncRNA (BANCR) in CRC progress, the relationship between Ets-1 and BANCR was investigated here to illustrate the fentanyl-induced mechanism on CRC in vitro.METHODS: The expression levels of Ets-1 and BANCR were first detected in fentanyl-treated CRC cells. The interaction between Ets-1 and BANCR promoter was verified with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, as well as corresponding acetylation of histones. The regulation of Ets-1 on BANCR expression was confirmed through luciferase assays and RT-PCR analysis. And, cell clone formation, cell migration and invasion were observed to evaluate the anti-tumor effects of fentanyl. Ets-1 overexpression or co-overexpression with BANCR was further performed by plasmids transfection to show the regulatory role of Ets-1 in fentanyl-induced mechanism.RESULTS: Fentanyl induced BANCR upregulation and Ets-1 downregulation in CRC cells. Further studies showed that Ets-1 negatively regulated BANCR expression via the deacetylation of histones H3 within BANCR promoter. Moreover, fentanyl induced less cell clone formation, as well as inhibited cell migration and invasion in vitro, while Ets-1 overexpression inhibited fentanyl-induced effects that could be reversed by BANCR co-overexpression.CONCLUSION: Fentanyl showed anti-tumor like effects on CRC cells, including less cell clone formation and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the regulatory role of Ets-1 on BANCR influenced fentanyl-induced mechanism, indicating their potential application in the therapeutic treatment of CRC.'

aS'Identification of non-coding RNAs with a new composite feature in the Hybrid Random Forest Ensemble algorithm.\r\nTo identify non-coding RNA (ncRNA) signals within genomic regions, a classification tool was developed based on a hybrid random forest (RF) with a logistic regression model to efficiently discriminate short ncRNA sequences as well as long complex ncRNA sequences. This RF-based classifier was trained on a well-balanced dataset with a discriminative set of features and achieved an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 92.11%, 90.7% and 93.5%, respectively. The selected feature set includes a new proposed feature, SCORE. This feature is generated based on a logistic regression function that combines five significant features-structure, sequence, modularity, structural robustness and coding potential-to enable improved characterization of long ncRNA (lncRNA) elements. The use of SCORE improved the performance of the RF-based classifier in the identification of Rfam lncRNA families. A genome-wide ncRNA classification framework was applied to a wide variety of organisms, with an emphasis on those of economic, social, public health, environmental and agricultural significance, such as various bacteria genomes, the Arthrospira (Spirulina) genome, and rice and human genomic regions. Our framework was able to identify known ncRNAs with sensitivities of greater than 90% and 77.7% for prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences, respectively. Our classifier is available at http://ncrna-pred.com/HLRF.htm.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 regulates endothelial cell function and vessel growth.\r\nRATIONALE: The human genome harbors a large number of sequences encoding for RNAs that are not translated but control cellular functions by distinct mechanisms. The expression and function of the longer transcripts namely the long noncoding RNAs in the vasculature are largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: Here, we characterized the expression of long noncoding RNAs in human endothelial cells and elucidated the function of the highly expressed metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1).METHODS AND RESULTS: Endothelial cells of different origin express relative high levels of the conserved long noncoding RNAs MALAT1, taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1), maternally expressed 3 (MEG3), linc00657, and linc00493. MALAT1 was significantly increased by hypoxia and controls a phenotypic switch in endothelial cells. Silencing of MALAT1 by small interfering RNAs or GapmeRs induced a promigratory response and increased basal sprouting and migration, whereas proliferation of endothelial cells was inhibited. When angiogenesis was further stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, MALAT1 small interfering RNAs induced discontinuous sprouts indicative of defective proliferation of stalk cells. In vivo studies confirmed that genetic ablation of MALAT1 inhibited proliferation of endothelial cells and reduced neonatal retina vascularization. Pharmacological inhibition of MALAT1 by GapmeRs reduced blood flow recovery and capillary density after hindlimb ischemia. Gene expression profiling followed by confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that silencing of MALAT1 impaired the expression of various cell cycle regulators.CONCLUSIONS: Silencing of MALAT1 tips the balance from a proliferative to a migratory endothelial cell phenotype in vitro, and its genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition reduces vascular growth in vivo.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA ANRIL regulates inflammatory responses as a novel component of NF-\xce\xbaB pathway.\r\nAntisense Noncoding RNA in the INK4 Locus (ANRIL) is the prime candidate gene at Chr9p21, the well-defined genetic risk locus associated with multiple human diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD), while little is known regarding its role in the pathological processes. Endothelial dysfunction triggers atherosclerotic processes that are causatively linked to CAD. To evaluate the function of ANRIL in human endothelial cells (ECs), we examined ANRIL expression under pathological stimuli and found ANRIL was markedly induced by pro-inflammatory factors. Loss-of-function and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches revealed that NF-\xce\xbaB mediates TNF-\xce\xb1 induced ANRIL expression. RNA sequencing revealed that ANRIL silencing dysregulated expression of inflammatory genes including IL6 and IL8 under TNF-\xce\xb1 treatment. We explored the regulatory mechanism of ANRIL on IL6/8 and found that Yin Yang 1 (YY1), an ANRIL binding transcriptional factor revealed by RNA immunoprecipitation, was required for IL6/8 expression under TNF-\xce\xb1 treatment. YY1 was enriched at promoter loci of IL6/8 and ANRIL silencing impaired the enrichment, indicating a cooperation between ANRIL and YY1 in the regulation of inflammatory genes. For the first time, we establish the connection between ANRIL and NF-\xce\xbaB pathway and show that ANRIL regulates inflammatory responses through binding with YY1. The newly identified TNF-\xce\xb1-NF-\xce\xbaB-ANRIL/YY1-IL6/8 pathway enhances understanding of the etiology of CAD and provides potential therapeutic target for treatment of CAD.'

aS'Ftx is dispensable for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in preimplantation mouse embryos.\r\nX-chromosome inactivation (XCI) equalizes gene expression between the sexes by inactivating one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. Xist has been considered as a major cis-acting factor that inactivates the paternally derived X chromosome (Xp) in preimplantation mouse embryos (imprinted XCI). Ftx has been proposed as a positive regulator of Xist. However, the physiological role of Ftx in female animals has never been studied. We recently reported that Ftx is located in the cis-acting regulatory region of the imprinted XCI and expressed from the inactive Xp, suggesting a role in the imprinted XCI mechanism. Here we examined the effects on imprinted XCI using targeted deletion of Ftx. Disruption of Ftx did not affect the survival of female embryos or expression of Xist and other X-linked genes in the preimplantation female embryos. Our results indicate that Ftx is dispensable for imprinted XCI in preimplantation embryos.'

aS'Switching cell fate, ncRNAs coming to play.\r\nCell fate decision is a critical step during physiological development when embryonic stem cells commit to either becoming adult stem cells or somatic cells. Recent advances in reprogramming demonstrate that a similar set of transcription factors (TFs), which are important for maintaining the pluripotent state of stem cells, can also reprogram somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In addition, trans-differentiation, which entails the use of different sets of defined factors, whereby one type of somatic cell can be directly converted into another and even to cell types from different germ layers has become a parallel widely used approach for switching cell fate. All these progresses have provided powerful tools to manipulate cells for basic science and therapeutic purposes. Besides protein-based factors, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), particularly microRNAs and long ncRNAs, are also involved in cell fate determination, including maintaining self-renewal of pluripotent stem cells and directing cell lineage. Targeting specific ncRNAs represents an alternative promising approach to optimize cell-based disease modeling and regenerative therapy. Here we focus on recent advances of ncRNAs in cell fate decision, including ncRNA-induced iPSCs and lineage conversion. We also discuss some underlying mechanisms and implications in molecular pathogenesis of human diseases.'

aS'Extensive microRNA-mediated crosstalk between lncRNAs and mRNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells.\r\nRecently, a handful of intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to compete with mRNAs for binding to miRNAs and to contribute to development and disease. Beyond these reports, little is yet known of the extent and functional consequences of miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA levels by lncRNAs. To gain further insight into lncRNA-mRNA miRNA-mediated crosstalk, we reanalyzed transcriptome-wide changes induced by the targeted knockdown of over 100 lncRNA transcripts in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We predicted that, on average, almost one-fifth of the transcript level changes induced by lncRNAs are dependent on miRNAs that are highly abundant in mESCs. We validated these findings experimentally by temporally profiling transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression following the loss of miRNA biogenesis in mESCs. Following the depletion of miRNAs, we found that &gt;50% of lncRNAs and their miRNA-dependent mRNA targets were up-regulated coordinately, consistent with their interaction being miRNA-mediated. These lncRNAs are preferentially located in the cytoplasm, and the response elements for miRNAs they share with their targets have been preserved in mammals by purifying selection. Lastly, miRNA-dependent mRNA targets of each lncRNA tended to share common biological functions. Post-transcriptional miRNA-mediated crosstalk between lncRNAs and mRNA, in mESCs, is thus surprisingly prevalent, conserved in mammals, and likely to contribute to critical developmental processes.'

aS'A functional lncRNA HOTAIR genetic variant contributes to gastric cancer susceptibility.\r\nLong noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer development. HOTAIR could induce genome-wide retargeting of polycomb-repressive complex 2, trimethylates histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27me3) and deregulation of multiple downstream genes. Additionally, as the ceRNA of miR-331-3p, HOTAIR may modulate HER2 deregulation in gastric cancer cells. We hypothesized that the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HOTAIR may affect HOTAIR expression and/or its function and, thus, gastric cancer risk. We examined the association between three haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNP) across the whole HOTAIR locus and gastric cancer risk as well as the functional relevance of a gastric cancer susceptibility SNP rs920778. Genotypes were determined in two independent hospital-based case-control sets that consisted of 800 gastric cancer patients and 1600 controls. The allele-specific regulation on HOTAIR expression by the rs920778 SNP was examined in vitro and in vivo. We found that the HOTAIR rs920778 TT carriers had a 1.66- and 1.87-fold increased gastric cancer risk in Jinan and Huaian populations compared with the CC carriers (P = 4.2 \xc3\x97 10(-4) and 6.5 \xc3\x97 10(-5)). During inspecting functional relevance of the rs920778 SNP, we observed an allelic regulation of rs920778 on HOTAIR expression in both gastric cancer cell lines and tissue samples, with higher HOTAIR expression among T allele carriers. These findings elucidate that functional genetic variants influencing lncRNA expression may explain a portion of gastric cancer genetic basis.'

aS'Microarray expression profile analysis of long non-coding RNAs in human breast cancer: a study of Chinese women.\r\nBreast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression. Numerous lncRNAs have performed critical roles in cancer biology including breast cancer (BC). The expression levels of certain lncRNAs are associated with tumor development, recurrence, metastasis, and prognosis. However, the potential roles that lncRNAs regulate breast cancer tumorigenesis and tumor progression are still poorly understood. To investigate the potential roles of lncRNAs in the breast cancer, we constructed BC related lncRNA libraries by using microarray. Microarray expression profiling suggests 790 up-regulated and 637 down-regulated (log fold-change&gt;2.3) lncRNAs were differently expressed between BC tissues and its paired adjacent tissues. Furthermore, we found differently expressed lncRNAs associated with immune regulation. RP4-583P15.10, an up-regulated lncRNA, was found to be located downstream of the natural antisense of the ZBTB46 gene, which may regulated breast cancer through influence immune system. In conclusion, our results for the first time indicate that distinct lncRNAs expression profiles of BC, which related to the immune network, may provide information for further research on immune regulation during the BC process.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA FER1L4 suppresses cancer cell growth by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and regulating PTEN expression.\r\nAberrantly expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with various cancers. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of most cancers are unclear. Here, we report that the lncRNA FER1L4 (fer-1-like family member 4, pseudogene) acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of PTEN (a well-known tumor suppressor gene) by taking up miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. We observed that FER1L4 was downregulated in gastric cancer and that its level corresponded with that of PTEN mRNA. Both FER1L4 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p. Further experiments demonstrated that FER1L4 downregulation liberates miR-106a-5p and decreases the abundances of PTEN mRNA and protein. More importantly, FER1L4 downregulation accelerated cell proliferation by promoting the G0/G1 to S phase transition. We conclude that one mechanism by which lncRNAs function in in tumorigenesis is as ceRNAs for tumor suppressor mRNAs.'

aS'Upregulation of long noncoding RNA ZEB1-AS1 promotes tumor metastasis and predicts poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Despite progress in diagnostics and treatment of HCC, its prognosis remains poor. Emerging studies showed that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have crucial regulatory roles in cancer biology. In the current study, differentially expressed lncRNAs between HCC and paired non-tumor tissues were identified using microarrays. The effects of a specific differentially expressed lncRNA (termed ZEB1-AS1) on tumor progression were investigated in vitro and in vivo. We found that ZEB1-AS1 is frequently upregulated in HCC samples, especially in metastatic tumor tissues. DNA methylation analysis shows a tumor-specific ZEB1-AS1 promoter hypomethylation. Aberrant methylation is tightly correlated with overexpression of ZEB1-AS1 in HCC. Patients with ZEB1-AS1 hypomethylation or with high ZEB1-AS1 expression have poor recurrence-free survival. Functionally, ZEB1-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis, acts as an oncogene in HCC. The ZEB1-AS1 gene is located in physical contiguity with ZEB1 and positively regulates the ZEB1 expression. ZEB1 inhibition partially abrogates ZEB1-AS1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis. Our results provide novel insights into the function of lncRNA-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, highlight the important role of ZEB1-AS1 and ZEB1 in HCC progression, and indicate that ZEB1-AS1 may be served as a valuable prognostic biomarker for HCC.'

aS"lncRNA directs cooperative epigenetic regulation downstream of chemokine signals.\r\nlncRNAs are known to regulate a number of different developmental and tumorigenic processes. Here, we report a role for lncRNA BCAR4 in breast cancer metastasis that is mediated by chemokine-induced binding of BCAR4 to two transcription factors with extended regulatory consequences. BCAR4 binding of SNIP1 and PNUTS in response to CCL21 releases the SNIP1's inhibition of p300-dependent histone acetylation, which in turn enables the BCAR4-recruited PNUTS to bind H3K18ac and relieve inhibition of RNA Pol II via activation of the PP1 phosphatase. This mechanism activates a noncanonical Hedgehog/GLI2 transcriptional program that promotes cell migration. BCAR4 expression correlates with advanced breast cancers, and therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR4 strongly suppresses breast cancer metastasis in mouse models. The findings reveal a disease-relevant lncRNA mechanism consisting of both direct coordinated protein recruitment and indirect regulation of transcription factors."

aS'Expression quantitative trait loci in long non-coding RNA ZNRD1-AS1 influence cervical cancer development.\r\nZinc ribbon domain containing 1 (ZNRD1) may play integral roles in immune response against HPV infection and cervical cancer. Its antisense transcript, ZNRD1-AS1, is an important regulator of ZNRD1. By bioinformatics analyses, we identified that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNRD1-AS1 may be expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for ZNRD1. So we hypothesized that these eQTLs SNPs in ZNRD1-AS1 may influence the susceptibility of cervical cancer through influencing ZNRD1 expression. We designed a population-based case-control study containing 1486 cervical cancer patients and 1536 controls to test the associations of three ZNRD1 eQTLs SNPs (rs3757328, rs6940552 and rs9261204) in ZNRD1-AS1 with the risk of cervical cancer. Logistic regression analyses in additive genetic model showed that all the three eQTLs SNPs decreased the risk of cervical cancer. Compared with those carrying "0" variant allele, subjects carrying "1-6" variant alleles had a 20% decreased risk of cervical cancer. Moreover, the haplotype containing variant alleles of these three SNPs significantly decreased the risk of cervical cancer when compared with the most frequent haplotype. In conclusion, ZNRD1 eQTLs SNPs in ZNRD1-AS1 could have a predisposition for the development of cervical cancer.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA, Jpx, is a molecular switch for X chromosome inactivation.\r\nOnce protein-coding, the X-inactivation center (Xic) is now dominated by large noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). X chromosome inactivation (XCI) equalizes gene expression between mammalian males and females by inactivating one X in female cells. XCI requires Xist, an ncRNA that coats the X and recruits Polycomb proteins. How Xist is controlled remains unclear but likely involves negative and positive regulators. For the active X, the antisense Tsix RNA is an established Xist repressor. For the inactive X, here, we identify Xic-encoded Jpx as an Xist activator. Jpx is developmentally regulated and accumulates during XCI. Deleting Jpx blocks XCI and is female lethal. Posttranscriptional Jpx knockdown recapitulates the knockout, and supplying Jpx in trans rescues lethality. Thus, Jpx is trans-acting and functions as ncRNA. Furthermore, \xce\x94Jpx is rescued by truncating Tsix, indicating an antagonistic relationship between the ncRNAs. We conclude that Xist is controlled by two RNA-based switches: Tsix for Xa and Jpx for Xi.'

aS'The aberrant expression of MEG3 regulated by UHRF1 predicts the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nMEG3 as a tumor suppressor has been reported to be linked with pathogenesis of malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism of MEG3 in HCC still remains unclear. In our study, the aberrant decreased level of MEG3 in 72 tumor tissues obtained from HCC patients and cell lines was examined by using real-time PCR. The inhibition affection in proliferation and inducing affection in apoptosis was further confirmed in vivo and vitro, we also demonstrated that MEG3 regulates HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis partially via the accumulation of p53. Besides, the hypermethylation of MEG3 in promoter region was identified by bisulfite sequencing while MEG3 increased with the inhibition of methylation. Subsequently, UHRF1, a new identified oncogene which is required for DNA methylation and recruits, was investigated. A negative correlation of MEG3 and UHRF1 expression was verified in primary HCC tissues. Down-regulation of UHRF1 induced MEG3 expression in HCC cell lines, which could be reversed by the up-regulation of UHRF1. In addition, up-regulation of MEG3 in HCC cells partially diminished the promotion of proliferation induced by UHRF1. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the patients with low expression of MEG3 indicated worse overall and relapse-free survivals compared with high expression of MEG3. Cox proportional hazards analyses showed that MEG3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated MEG3, acting as a potential biomarker in predicting the prognosis of HCC, was regulated by UHRF1 via recruiting DNMT1 and regulated p53 expression.'

aS'Long non-coding RNAs differentially expressed between normal versus primary breast tumor tissues disclose converse changes to breast cancer-related protein-coding genes.\r\nBreast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death in women, is a highly heterogeneous disease, characterized by distinct genomic and transcriptomic profiles. Transcriptome analyses prevalently assessed protein-coding genes; however, the majority of the mammalian genome is expressed in numerous non-coding transcripts. Emerging evidence supports that many of these non-coding RNAs are specifically expressed during development, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. The focus of this study was to investigate the expression features and molecular characteristics of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in breast cancer. We investigated 26 breast tumor and 5 normal tissue samples utilizing a custom expression microarray enclosing probes for mRNAs as well as novel and previously identified lncRNAs. We identified more than 19,000 unique regions significantly differentially expressed between normal versus breast tumor tissue, half of these regions were non-coding without any evidence for functional open reading frames or sequence similarity to known proteins. The identified non-coding regions were primarily located in introns (53%) or in the intergenic space (33%), frequently orientated in antisense-direction of protein-coding genes (14%), and commonly distributed at promoter-, transcription factor binding-, or enhancer-sites. Analyzing the most diverse mRNA breast cancer subtypes Basal-like versus Luminal A and B resulted in 3,025 significantly differentially expressed unique loci, including 682 (23%) for non-coding transcripts. A notable number of differentially expressed protein-coding genes displayed non-synonymous expression changes compared to their nearest differentially expressed lncRNA, including an antisense lncRNA strongly anticorrelated to the mRNA coding for histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which was investigated in more detail. Previously identified chromatin-associated lncRNAs (CARs) were predominantly downregulated in breast tumor samples, including CARs located in the protein-coding genes for CALD1, FTX, and HNRNPH1. In conclusion, a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs have been identified with relation to cancer-related protein-coding genes.'

aS'Long non-coding RNAs are differentially expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines with differing metastatic potential.\r\nBACKGROUND: Metastasis is a major reason for poor prognosis in patients with cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A salient feature is the ability of cancer cells to colonize different organs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in numerous cellular processes, including metastasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the lncRNA expression profiles of two HCC cell lines, one with high potential for metastasis to the lung (HCCLM3) and the other to lymph nodes (HCCLYM-H2) were assessed using the Arraystar Human LncRNA Array v2.0, which contains 33,045 lncRNAs and 30,215 mRNAs. Coding-non-coding gene co-expression (CNC) networks were constructed and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify lncRNAs with potential functions in organ-specific metastasis. Levels of two representative lncRNAs and one representative mRNA, RP5-1014O16.1, lincRNA-TSPAN8 and TSPAN8, were further detected in HCC cell lines with differing metastasis potential by qRT-PCR.RESULTS: Using microarray data, we identified 1,482 lncRNAs and 1,629 mRNAs that were differentially expressed (\xe2\x89\xa51.5 fold-change) between the two HCC cell lines. The most upregulated lncRNAs in H2 were RP11-672F9.1, RP5-1014O16.1, and RP11-501G6.1, while the most downregulated ones were lincRNA-TSPAN8, lincRNA-CALCA, C14orf132, NCRNA00173, and CR613944. The most upregulated mRNAs in H2 were C15orf48, PSG2, and PSG8, while the most downregulated ones were CALCB, CD81, CD24, TSPAN8, and SOST. Among them, lincRNA-TSPAN8 and TSPAN8 were found highly expressed in high lung metastatic potential HCC cells, while lowly expressed in no or low lung metastatic potential HCC cells. RP5- 1014O16.1 was highly expressed in high lymphatic metastatic potential HCC cell lines, while lowly expressed in no lymphatic metastatic potential HCC cell lines.CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first detailed description of lncRNA expression profiles related to organ-specific metastasis in HCC. We demonstrated that a large number of lncRNAs may play important roles in driving HCC cells to metastasize to different sites; these lncRNAs may provide novel molecular biomarkers and offer a new basis for combating metastasis in HCC cases.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA HOXA-AS2 promotes gastric cancer proliferation by epigenetically silencing P21/PLK3/DDIT3 expression.\r\nCurrent evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be an important class of functional regulators involved in human cancers development, including gastric cancer (GC). Here, we reported that HOXA cluster antisense RNA2 (HOXA-AS2), a 1048bp RNA, was upregulated in GC. Increased HOXA-AS2 expression in GC was associated with larger tumor size and higher clinical stage; patients with higher levels of HOXA-AS2 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Further experiments revealed that HOXA-AS2 knockdown significantly inhibited GC cells proliferation by causing G1 arrest and promoting apoptosis, whereas HOXA-AS2 overexpression promoted cell growth. Furthermore, HOXA-AS2 could epigenetically repress the expression of P21, PLK3, and DDIT3 via binding with EZH2 (enhaner of zeste homolog 2), a key component of PRC2; ChIP assays demonstrated that EZH2 could directly bind to the promoter of P21, PLK3 and DDIT3, inducing H3K27 trimethylated. In conclusion, these data suggest that HOXA-AS2 could be an oncogene for GC partly through suppressing P21, PLK3, and DDIT3 expression; HOXA-AS2 may be served as a candidate prognostic biomarker and target for new therapies in human GC.'

aS'BRG1 expression is increased in thoracic aortic aneurysms and regulates proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells through the long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1 in vitro.\r\nOBJECTIVES: Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in cellular processes. However, little is known regarding their roles in thoracic aortic aneurysms. We investigated BRG1 expression in thoracic aortic aneurysms and the roles of BRG1 and the lncRNA HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro.METHODS: BRG1 mRNA and protein expression in human aortic media specimens were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical staining and western blot. BRG1 expression was up-regulated by lentiviral vectors. Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis were studied using Cell Counting Kit-8 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling assays. We performed western blots to detect Caspase3 and Bcl2 protein expression. LncRNAs regulated by BRG1 were identified through microarray in BRG1 gain- and loss-of-function vascular smooth muscle cells. Finally, the expression of HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 was reduced by siRNA and cell proliferation and apoptosis was studied using Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, caspase-3 activity assays and western blot.RESULTS: BRG1 expression in the aortic media was significantly higher in thoracic aortic aneurysms than in normal controls. Overexpression of BRG1 in human aortic smooth muscle cells promoted apoptosis and reduced proliferation. The expression of HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 was significantly down- and up-regulated in BRG1 knock-down and overexpressing vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. We further demonstrated that suppression of HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 by siRNA in vascular smooth muscle cells reduced apoptosis and promoted proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: BRG1 is overexpressed in the aortic media of thoracic aortic aneurysms and the interaction between BRG1 and HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 plays a key role in the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of thoracic aortic aneurysms.'

aS'Clopidogrel reduces apoptosis and promotes proliferation of human vascular endothelial cells induced by palmitic acid via suppression of the long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1 in vitro.\r\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is recognized as a major and increasing health problem affected older subjects in China, and clopidogrel has been widely used for treatment of CVD patients such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion damage. However, the molecular mechanisms of clopidogrel for treatment of CVD are only partially understood. This study investigated the effects of clopidogrel on palmitic acid-induced damage of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the molecular mechanisms of LncRNA HIF1A-AS1 in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of HUVECs in vitro. We firstly established a damage model of HUVECs through palmitic acid (PA) treatment. And the effect of clopidogrel reducing PA-induced apoptosis of HUVECs was observed by the flow cytometric measurement. To further understand the molecular mechanism of clopidogrel rescues PA-induced apoptosis, we used human LncRNA PCR array to compare the LncRNA expression profile difference between clopidogrel-treated cells and control cells. The expression of LncRNA HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 (HIF1A-AS1) was significantly altered in clopidogrel-treated cells. We further proved that suppression of HIF1A-AS1 by siRNA reduce PA-induced apoptosis and promote proliferation of HUVECs. Furthermore, we also demonstrated inhibition apoptosis effect by HIF1A-AS1 is related to mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Hence, our results suggest that clopidogrel rescues apoptosis and promotes proliferation of PA-induced damage model of HUVECs through inhibiting the mediator LncRNA HIF1A-AS1. These findings indicate that LncRNA HIF1A-AS1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD, and provide a novel molecular mechanism of clopidogrel for treatment of CVD.'

aS'HOXA11 silencing and endogenous HOXA11 antisense ribonucleic acid in the uterine endometrium.\r\nHoxa11 is an essential regulator of embryonic uterine development and the cyclic development of the adult uterine endometrium. Hoxa11 is required for female fertility, as evidenced by targeted mutation. Here we demonstrate a naturally occurring Hoxa11 (mouse)/HOXA11 (human) antisense transcript present in the adult mouse and human endometrium. HOXA11 antisense transcript levels varied during the menstrual cycle, with peak antisense RNA levels occurring in the midproliferative phase, varying inversely with mRNA expression levels. HOXA11 protein levels correlated temporally with peak mRNA levels. In primary stromal cell culture, progesterone down-regulated HOXA11 antisense transcription, and this was followed by up-regulation of HOXA11 mRNA, suggesting a possible role for the antisense transcript in regulating mRNA expression. Attempts to block Hoxa11 function by transfection of the murine uterus with Hoxa11 antisense oligonucleotides failed to interrupt normal uterine function, suggesting that Hoxa11 antisense does not regulate Hoxa11 mRNA by formulation of sense/antisense duplexes. We propose that HOXA11 antisense functions by transcriptional interference, repressing HOXA11 expression by competing for transcription of the common gene, rather than by sense/antisense interaction.'

aS'Long Non-Coding RNAs in Endometrial Carcinoma.\r\nEndometrial carcinoma (EC), the second most common form of gynaecological malignancy, can be divided into two distinct sub-types: Type I tumours arise from hyperplastic endometrium and typically effect women around the time of menopause, whereas type II tumours arise in postmenopausal women from atrophic endometrium. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of non-protein coding molecules that have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of cancer including gynaecological tumours. Although they play critical physiological roles in cellular metabolism, their expression and function are deregulated in EC compared with paired normal tissue, indicating that they may also participate in tumour initiation and progression. For instance, the lncRNA MALAT-1 is down-regulated in EC samples compared to normal or hyperplastic endometrium, whereas the lncRNA OVAL is down-regulated in type II disease but up-regulated in type I disease. Other notatble lncRNAs such as HOTAIR, H19 and SRA become up-regulated with increasing EC tumour grade and other features associated with poor prognosis. In the current review, we will examine the growing body of evidence linking deregulated lncRNAs with specific biological functions of tumour cells in EC, we will highlight associations between lncRNAs and the molecular pathways implicated in EC tumourigenesis and we will identify critical knowledge gaps that remain to be addressed.'

aS'The polymorphism rs944289 predisposes to papillary thyroid carcinoma through a large intergenic noncoding RNA gene of tumor suppressor type.\r\nA genome-wide association study of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) pinpointed two independent SNPs (rs944289 and rs965513) located in regions containing no annotated genes (14q13.3 and 9q22.33, respectively). Here, we describe a unique, long, intergenic, noncoding RNA gene (lincRNA) named Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Susceptibility Candidate 3 (PTCSC3) located 3.2 kb downstream of rs944289 at 14q.13.3 and the expression of which is strictly thyroid specific. By quantitative PCR, PTCSC3 expression was strongly down-regulated (P = 2.84 \xc3\x97 10(-14)) in thyroid tumor tissue of 46 PTC patients and the risk allele (T) was associated with the strongest suppression (genotype [TT] (n = 21) vs. [CT] (n = 19), P = 0.004). In adjacent unaffected thyroid tissue, the genotype [TT] was associated with up-regulation of PTCSC3 ([TT] (n = 21) vs. [CT] (n = 19), P = 0.034). The SNP rs944289 was located in a binding site for the CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBP) \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2. The risk allele destroyed the binding site in silico. Both C/EBP\xce\xb1 and C/EBP\xce\xb2 activated the PTCSC3 promoter in reporter assays (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.0014, respectively) and the risk allele reduced the activation compared with the nonrisk allele (C) (P = 0.026 and P = 0.048, respectively). Restoration of PTCSC3 expression in PTC cell line cells (TPC-1 and BCPAP) inhibited cell growth (P = 0.002 and P = 0.019, respectively) and affected the expression of genes involved in DNA replication, recombination and repair, cellular movement, tumor morphology, and cell death. Our data suggest that SNP rs944289 predisposes to PTC through a previously uncharacterized, long intergenic noncoding RNA gene (PTCSC3) that has the characteristics of a tumor suppressor.'

aS'Integrative annotation of human large intergenic noncoding RNAs reveals global properties and specific subclasses.\r\nLarge intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of diverse cellular processes. Determining the function of individual lincRNAs remains a challenge. Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and computational methods allow for an unprecedented analysis of such transcripts. Here, we present an integrative approach to define a reference catalog of &gt;8000 human lincRNAs. Our catalog unifies previously existing annotation sources with transcripts we assembled from RNA-seq data collected from \xe2\x88\xbc4 billion RNA-seq reads across 24 tissues and cell types. We characterize each lincRNA by a panorama of &gt;30 properties, including sequence, structural, transcriptional, and orthology features. We found that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes, and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides. Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies and further functional classification of these genes.'

aS'Screening of lymph nodes metastasis associated lncRNAs in colorectal cancer patients.\r\nAIM: To screen lymph nodes metastasis associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer through microarray analysis.METHODS: Metastatic lymph node (MLN), normal lymph node (NLN) and tumor tissues of 3 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were collected during the operation and validated by pathological examinations. RNAs were extracted from MLN, NLN, and cancer tissues separately. RNA quantity and quality were measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer and RNA integrity was assessed by standard denaturing agarose electrophoresis. Agilent Feature Extraction Software (Version 11.0.1.1) was used to analyze acquired array images. Four differently expressed lncRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 26 subsets of MLN, NLN, and tumor tissues.RESULTS: Of 33045 lncRNAs, 1133 were differentially expressed in MLN compared with NLN, of which 260 were up-regulated and 873 down-regulated (\xe2\x89\xa5 2 fold-change). Five hundred and forty-five lncRNAs were differentially expressed in MLN compared with tumor tissues, of which 460 were up-regulated and 85 down-regulated (\xe2\x89\xa5 2 fold-change). Compared with NLN and cancer tissues, 14 lncRNAs were specifically up-regulated and 5 specifically down-regulated in MLN. AK307796, ENST00000425785, and AK021444 were confirmed to be specifically up-regulated in MLN and ENST00000465846 specifically down-regulated in MLN by qRT-PCR in 26 CRC patients.CONCLUSION: The specifically expressed lncRNAs in MLN may exert a partial or key role in the progress of lymph nodes metastasis of CRC.'

aS'A long noncoding RNA activated by TGF-\xce\xb2 promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThe role of TGF-\xce\xb2-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling is still unknown. In this study, we observed that the lncRNA-activated by TGF-\xce\xb2 (lncRNA-ATB) was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases and associated with poor prognosis. lncRNA-ATB upregulated ZEB1 and ZEB2 by competitively binding the miR-200 family and then induced EMT and invasion. In addition, lncRNA-ATB promoted organ colonization of disseminated tumor cells by binding IL-11 mRNA, autocrine induction of IL-11, and triggering STAT3 signaling. Globally, lncRNA-ATB promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade. Thus, these findings suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-\xce\xb2 signaling, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for antimetastatic therapies.'

aS'Comparative transcriptomic analysis of multiple cardiovascular fates from embryonic stem cells predicts novel regulators in human cardiogenesis.\r\nDissecting the gene expression programs which control the early stage cardiovascular development is essential for understanding the molecular mechanisms of human heart development and heart disease. Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) of highly purified human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs), hESC-derived Multipotential Cardiovascular Progenitors (MCPs) and MCP-specified three cardiovascular lineages. A novel algorithm, named as Gene Expression Pattern Analyzer (GEPA), was developed to obtain a refined lineage-specificity map of all sequenced genes, which reveals dynamic changes of transcriptional factor networks underlying early human cardiovascular development. Moreover, our GEPA predictions captured ~90% of top-ranked regulatory cardiac genes that were previously predicted based on chromatin signature changes in hESCs, and further defined their cardiovascular lineage-specificities, indicating that our multi-fate comparison analysis could predict novel regulatory genes. Furthermore, GEPA analysis revealed the MCP-specific expressions of genes in ephrin signaling pathway, positive role of which in cardiomyocyte differentiation was further validated experimentally. By using RNA-seq plus GEPA workflow, we also identified stage-specific RNA splicing switch and lineage-enriched long non-coding RNAs during human cardiovascular differentiation. Overall, our study utilized multi-cell-fate transcriptomic comparison analysis to establish a lineage-specific gene expression map for predicting and validating novel regulatory mechanisms underlying early human cardiovascular development.'

aS'Long Non-coding RNA ANRIL and Polycomb in Human Cancers and Cardiovascular Disease.\r\nThe long non-coding RNA CDKN2B-AS1, commonly referred to as the A ntisense N on-coding R NA in the I NK4 L ocus (ANRIL), is a 3.8-kb-long RNA transcribed from the short arm of human chromosome 9 on p21.3 that overlaps a critical region encompassing three major tumor suppressor loci juxtaposed to the INK4b-ARF-INK4a gene cluster and the methyl-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) gene. Genome-wide association studies have identified this region with a remarkable and growing number of disease-associated DNA alterations and single nucleotide polymorphisms, which corresponds to increased susceptibility to human disease. Recent attention has been devoted on whether these alterations in the ANRIL sequence affect its expression levels and/or its splicing transcript variation, and in consequence, global cellular homeostasis. Moreover, recent evidence postulates that ANRIL not only can regulate their immediate genomic neighbors in cis, but also has the capacity to regulate additional loci in trans. This action would further increase the complexity for mechanisms imposed through ANRIL and furthering the scope of this lncRNA in disease pathogenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the most recent findings on the investigation of ANRIL and provide a perspective on the biological and clinical significance of ANRIL as a putative biomarker, specifically, its potential role in directing cellular fates leading to cancer and cardiovascular disease.'

aS"Control of somatic tissue differentiation by the long non-coding RNA TINCR.\r\nSeveral of the thousands of human long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been functionally characterized; however, potential roles for lncRNAs in somatic tissue differentiation remain poorly understood. Here we show that a 3.7-kilobase lncRNA, terminal differentiation-induced ncRNA (TINCR), controls human epidermal differentiation by a post-transcriptional mechanism. TINCR is required for high messenger RNA abundance of key differentiation genes, many of which are mutated in human skin diseases, including FLG, LOR, ALOXE3, ALOX12B, ABCA12, CASP14 and ELOVL3. TINCR-deficient epidermis lacked terminal differentiation ultrastructure, including keratohyalin granules and intact lamellar bodies. Genome-scale RNA interactome analysis revealed that TINCR interacts with a range of differentiation mRNAs. TINCR-mRNA interaction occurs through a 25-nucleotide 'TINCR box' motif that is strongly enriched in interacting mRNAs and required for TINCR binding. A high-throughput screen to analyse TINCR binding capacity to approximately 9,400 human recombinant proteins revealed direct binding of TINCR RNA to the staufen1 (STAU1) protein. STAU1-deficient tissue recapitulated the impaired differentiation seen with TINCR depletion. Loss of UPF1 and UPF2, both of which are required for STAU1-mediated RNA decay, however, did not have differentiation effects. Instead, the TINCR-STAU1 complex seems to mediate stabilization of differentiation mRNAs, such as KRT80. These data identify TINCR as a key lncRNA required for somatic tissue differentiation, which occurs through lncRNA binding to differentiation mRNAs to ensure their expression."

aS'WIF1 re-expression in glioblastoma inhibits migration through attenuation of non-canonical WNT signaling by downregulating the lncRNA MALAT1.\r\nGlioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults and due to the invasive nature cannot be completely removed. The WNT inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), a secreted inhibitor of WNTs, is systematically downregulated in glioblastoma and acts as strong tumor suppressor. The aim of this study was the dissection of WIF1-associated tumor-suppressing effects mediated by canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling. We found that WIF1 besides inhibiting the canonical WNT pathway selectively downregulates the WNT/calcium pathway associated with significant reduction of p38-MAPK (p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation. Knockdown of WNT5A, the only WNT ligand overexpressed in glioblastoma, phenocopied this inhibitory effect. WIF1 expression inhibited cell migration in vitro and in an orthotopic brain tumor model, in accordance with the known regulatory function of the WNT/Ca(2+) pathway on migration and invasion. In search of a mediator for this function differential gene expression profiles of WIF1-expressing cells were performed. Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), a long non-coding RNA and key positive regulator of invasion, emerged as the top downregulated gene. Indeed, knockdown of MALAT1 reduced migration in glioblastoma cells, without effect on proliferation. Hence, loss of WIF1 enhances the migratory potential of glioblastoma through WNT5A that activates the WNT/Ca(2+) pathway and MALAT1. These data suggest the involvement of canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways in glioblastoma promoting key features associated with this deadly disease, proliferation on one hand and invasion on the other. Successful targeting will require a dual strategy affecting both canonical and non-canonical WNT pathways.'

aS'ncRuPAR inhibits gastric cancer progression by down-regulating protease-activated receptor-1.\r\nncRuPAR is a newly discovered long noncoding RNA molecule that can upregulate protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) during embryonic growth; however, its role in cancer has not been elucidated. Here, we conducted a study to investigate the role of ncRuPAR in gastric cancer. Significant downregulation of ncRuPAR was detected in gastric cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues; however, both PAR-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Additionally, the expression level of ncRuPAR was found to be significantly correlated with tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, tumor size, and tumor-nodes-metastasis (TNM) stage and inversely associated with the mRNA levels and extent (E) \xc3\x97 intensity (I) scores of PAR-1 and VEGF. The protein level of PAR-1 was significantly correlated with tumor size only, while the VEGF protein level was significantly correlated with invasion depth and tumor size. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of ncRuPAR was 0.84 (95 % CI 0.79-0.88) at a cutoff value of 4.97; ncRuPAR had a sensitivity of 88.41 %, a specificity of 73.91 %, and an accuracy of 81.16 % for the prediction of gastric cancer. These results suggest that ncRuPAR inhibits gastric cancer development, and its underlying mechanism involves the inhibition of PAR-1. In addition, ncRuPAR could be regarded as a marker for gastric cancer in the future.'

aS'HOX antisense lincRNA HOXA-AS2 is an apoptosis repressor in all trans retinoic acid treated NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells.\r\nHOXA cluster antisense RNA 2 (HOXA-AS2) is a long non-coding RNA located between the HOXA3 and HOXA4 genes in the HOXA cluster. Its transcript is expressed in NB4 promyelocytic leukemia cells and human peripheral blood neutrophils, and expression is increased in NB4 cells treated with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Knockdown of HOXA-AS2 expression by transduced shRNA decreases the number of viable cells and increases the proportion of apoptotic cells, measured by annexin V binding and by activity and cleavage of caspases-3, -8, and -9. The increase in death of HOXA-AS2 knockdown cells was accompanied by an elevated TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) levels, but ATRA-induced NB4 cells treated with TRAIL did show an increase in HOXA-AS2 expression. These results demonstrate that ATRA induction of HOXA-AS2 suppresses ATRA-induced apoptosis, possibly through a TRAIL-mediated pathway. HOXA-AS2-mediated negative regulation thus contributes to the fine-tuning of apoptosis during ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation in NB4 cells.'

aS"Complex organization and structure of sense and antisense transcripts expressed from the DIO3 gene imprinted locus.\r\nThe human DIO3 gene and its mouse homolog, Dio3, map to chromosomes 14q32 and 12F1, respectively, and code for the type 3 deiodinase, an enzyme that inactivates thyroid hormones and is highly expressed during pregnancy and development. Mouse Dio3 is imprinted and preferentially expressed from the paternal allele in the fetus. We analyzed the human DIO3 genomic region and identified a gene (DIO3OS) that is transcribed in the antisense orientation. Multiple DIO3OS transcripts are expressed in most tissues. The structure of several DIO3OS cDNAs obtained by RT-PCR-based techniques reveals the occurrence of numerous splice variants. The exon-intron structures of DIO3OS are similar in mouse and human, but the homology of the exonic sequence is very low, except for the first exon, and no conserved open reading frame is present. We also detected DIO3 transcripts containing additional 5' untranslated sequence and a potential alternative upstream promoter for mouse Dio3. Exonic sequence of a Dio3os cDNA overlaps with the Dio3 promoter and strong promoter activity in the antisense orientation is detected in a genomic fragment located 3' of mouse and human DIO3 but not in the DIO3 promoter region. These results suggest that the DIO3 gene may lie within the structure of the antisense gene, a complex arrangement often observed in imprinted loci."

aS'SF3B1 mutations constitute a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.\r\nMutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing have been found to occur at relatively high frequencies in several tumour types including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, uveal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, and at lower frequencies in breast cancer. To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.'

aS'7SL RNA mediates virion packaging of the antiviral cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G.\r\nCytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) has broad antiviral activity against diverse retroviruses and/or retrotransposons, and its antiviral functions are believed to rely on its encapsidation into virions in an RNA-dependent fashion. However, the cofactors of A3G virion packaging have not yet been identified. We demonstrate here that A3G selectively interacts with certain polymerase III (Pol III)-derived RNAs, including Y3 and 7SL RNAs. Among A3G-binding Pol III-derived RNAs, 7SL RNA was preferentially packaged into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles. Efficient packaging of 7SL RNA, as well as A3G, was mediated by the RNA-binding nucleocapsid domain of HIV-1 Gag. A3G mutants that had reduced 7SL RNA binding but maintained wild-type levels of mRNA and tRNA binding were packaged poorly and had impaired antiviral activity. Reducing 7SL RNA packaging by overexpression of SRP19 proteins inhibited 7SL RNA and A3G virion packaging and impaired its antiviral function. Thus, 7SL RNA that is encapsidated into diverse retroviruses is a key cofactor of the antiviral A3G. This selective interaction of A3G with certain Pol III-derived RNAs raises the question of whether A3G and its cofactors may have as-yet-unidentified cellular functions.'

aS'Function and evolution of local repeats in the Firre locus.\r\nMore than half the human and mouse genomes are comprised of repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs), which have been implicated in many biological processes. In contrast, much less is known about other repeats, such as local repeats that occur in multiple instances within a given locus in the genome but not elsewhere. Here, we systematically characterize local repeats in the genomic locus of the Firre long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). We find a conserved function for the RRD repeat as a ribonucleic nuclear retention signal that is sufficient to retain an otherwise cytoplasmic mRNA in the nucleus. We also identified a repeat, termed R0, that can function as a DNA enhancer element within the intronic sequences of Firre. Collectively, our data suggest that local repeats can have diverse functionalities and molecular modalities in the Firre locus and perhaps more globally in other lncRNAs.'

aS'A novel biomarker Linc00974 interacting with KRT19 promotes proliferation and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nLocation-associated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was reported to interact with target protein via a cis-regulatory process especially for the Flank10kb class lncRNA. Based on this theory, we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanisms of Linc00974 and KRT19 (an lncRNA beyond the Flank10kb class with protein) when we first confirmed the aberrant expression in hepatocellular carcinoma in a previous study. Knockdown of Linc00974 resulted in an inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion with an activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro, which was also validated by a subcutaneous and tail vein/intraperitoneal injection xenotransplantation model in vivo. We further investigated the interaction pattern of Linc00974 and KRT19. MiR-642 was identified, by acting as the competing endogenous RNA in regulating Linc00974 and KRT19. Linc00974 was increased owing to an abnormal hypomethylation promoter, which induced the upregulation of KRT19 via ceRNA interaction, resulting in the activation of the Notch and TGF-\xce\xb2 pathways as detected by cDNA microarray. We also discovered Linc00974F-1 stably expressed in the plasma. By the combined analysis of Linc00974F-1 with CYFRA21-1, we found that these joint indicators predicted growth and metastasis of tumor in HCC patients. In conclusion, the combination of Linc00974 and KRT19 may be novel indices for clinical diagnosis of tumor growth and metastasis in HCC, while Linc00974 may become a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of HCC progression.'

aS'Identification of a long non-coding RNA as a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for metastatic prostate cancer.\r\nMetastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is still an incurable disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may be an overlooked source of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We therefore performed RNA sequencing on paired metastatic/non-metastatic PCa xenografts derived from clinical specimens. The most highly up-regulated transcript was LOC728606, a lncRNA now designated PCAT18. PCAT18 is specifically expressed in the prostate compared to 11 other normal tissues (p&lt;0.05) and up-regulated in PCa compared to 15 other neoplasms (p&lt;0.001). Cancer-specific up-regulation of PCAT18 was confirmed on an independent dataset of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia samples (p&lt;0.001). PCAT18 was detectable in plasma samples and increased incrementally from healthy individuals to those with localized and metastatic PCa (p&lt;0.01). We identified a PCAT18-associated expression signature (PES), which is highly PCa-specific and activated in metastatic vs. primary PCa samples (p&lt;1E-4, odds ratio&gt;2). The PES was significantly associated with androgen receptor (AR) signalling. Accordingly, AR activation dramatically up-regulated PCAT18 expression in vitro and in vivo. PCAT18 silencing significantly (p&lt;0.001) inhibited PCa cell proliferation and triggered caspase 3/7 activation, with no effect on non-neoplastic cells. PCAT18 silencing also inhibited PCa cell migration (p&lt;0.01) and invasion (p&lt;0.01). These results position PCAT18 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for metastatic PCa.'

aS'PAR-CLIP analysis uncovers AUF1 impact on target RNA fate and genome integrity.\r\nPost-transcriptional gene regulation is robustly regulated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Here we describe the collection of RNAs regulated by AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), an RBP linked to cancer, inflammation and aging. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) analysis reveals that AUF1 primarily recognizes U-/GU-rich sequences in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs and influences target transcript fate in three main directions. First, AUF1 lowers the steady-state levels of numerous target RNAs, including long noncoding RNA NEAT1, in turn affecting the organization of nuclear paraspeckles. Second, AUF1 does not change the abundance of many target RNAs, but ribosome profiling reveals that AUF1 promotes the translation of numerous mRNAs in this group. Third, AUF1 unexpectedly enhances the steady-state levels of several target mRNAs encoding DNA-maintenance proteins. Through its actions on target RNAs, AUF1 preserves genomic integrity, in agreement with the AUF1-elicited prevention of premature cellular senescence.'

aS'Conserved principles of mammalian transcriptional regulation revealed by RNA half-life.\r\nRNA levels in a cell are regulated by the relative rates of RNA synthesis and decay. We recently developed a new approach for measuring both RNA synthesis and decay in a single experimental setting by biosynthetic labeling of newly transcribed RNA. Here, we show that this provides measurements of RNA half-lives from microarray data with a so far unreached accuracy. Based on such measurements of RNA half-lives for human B-cells and mouse fibroblasts, we identified conserved regulatory principles for a large number of biological processes. We show that different regulatory patterns between functionally similar proteins are characterized by differences in the half-life of the corresponding transcripts and can be identified by measuring RNA half-life. We identify more than 100 protein families which show such differential regulatory patterns in both species. Additionally, we provide strong evidence that the activity of protein complexes consisting of subunits with overall long transcript half-lives can be regulated by transcriptional regulation of individual key subunits with short-lived transcripts. Based on this observation, we predict more than 100 key regulatory subunits for human complexes of which 28% could be confirmed in mice (P &lt; 10(-9)). Therefore, this atlas of transcript half-lives provides new fundamental insights into many cellular processes.'

aS'Expression and clinical significance of the long non-coding RNA PVT1 in human gastric cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Highly sensitive markers are urgently needed for the diagnosis and grading of gastric cancer and for managing drug resistance. The recent identification of long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has provided new approaches for resolving this challenge. The aim of this study was to screen and identify new biomarkers for human gastric cancer from lncRNAs.METHODS: First, we used lncRNA microarrays to conduct a preliminary screening for candidate lncRNAs of gastric cancer biomarkers in both human gastric cancer tissues and in two gastric cancer cell lines, SGC7901 cells and paclitaxel-resistant SGC7901 cells. The lncRNA plasma-cytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) was found to exhibit higher expression in both gastric cancer tissues and the SGC7901 paclitaxel-resistant cell line. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for large-scale analysis in a large number of human gastric cancer tissues to verify the involvement of PVT1 in development of gastric cancer. The relationships between PVT1 expression and clinical features were also analyzed.RESULTS: PVT1 showed higher expression in human gastric cancer tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues and in SGC7901 paclitaxel-resistant cells compared with SGC7901 cells. PVT1 expression was correlated with lymph node invasion of gastric cancer.CONCLUSION: PVT1 is a new biomarker for human gastric cancer and may indicate lymph node invasion. Therefore, PVT1 shows potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer and enhancement of paclitaxel sensitivity.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5  is involved in ovarian cancer cell apoptosis through  the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway.\r\nThe present study investigated the underlying role of growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), which is the main cause of death in women with malignant tumor of the genital system. In vivo GAS5 expression in 60 EOC specimens was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR, which was used to study the differences of GAS5 expression between EOC tissues and normal ovarian epithelium. In vitro GAS5 overexpression was applied to discover the biological functions in EOC cell lines. 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and colony formation assays were employed to investigate the effect on proliferation. The function of apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling, and JC-1 probe staining, and migration and invasion were detected by Transwell assay. The data show that no significant differences of GAS5 expression were observed between normal ovarian epithelium and benign epithelial lesions; however, GAS5 expression was lower in EOC tissues compared with normal ovarian epithelial tissues (6.44-fold), which was closely related to lymph node metastasis (P=0.025) and tumor node metastasis stage (P=0.035). Moreover, exogenous GAS5-inhibited proliferation promoted apoptosis and decreased migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Finally, through mitochondrial potential and western blot analyses, GAS5 could disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential and promote BAX, BAK, cleaved-caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 9 expression. Taken together, the findings of the present study revealed that GAS5 is downregulated in EOC specimens, and GAS5 inhibits EOC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promotes cell apoptosis. GAS5 can serve as a novel therapeutic target in patients with EOC.'

aS"An RNA gene expressed during cortical development evolved rapidly in humans.\r\nThe developmental and evolutionary mechanisms behind the emergence of human-specific brain features remain largely unknown. However, the recent ability to compare our genome to that of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, provides new avenues to link genetic and phenotypic changes in the evolution of the human brain. We devised a ranking of regions in the human genome that show significant evolutionary acceleration. Here we report that the most dramatic of these 'human accelerated regions', HAR1, is part of a novel RNA gene (HAR1F) that is expressed specifically in Cajal-Retzius neurons in the developing human neocortex from 7 to 19 gestational weeks, a crucial period for cortical neuron specification and migration. HAR1F is co-expressed with reelin, a product of Cajal-Retzius neurons that is of fundamental importance in specifying the six-layer structure of the human cortex. HAR1 and the other human accelerated regions provide new candidates in the search for uniquely human biology."

aS'Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA stability.\r\nTranscriptomic analyses have identified tens of thousands of intergenic, intronic, and cis-antisense long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are expressed from mammalian genomes. Despite progress in functional characterization, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs and their half-lives. Although many are easily detectable by a variety of techniques, it has been assumed that lncRNAs are generally unstable, but this has not been examined genome-wide. Utilizing a custom noncoding RNA array, we determined the half-lives of \xe2\x88\xbc800 lncRNAs and \xe2\x88\xbc12,000 mRNAs in the mouse Neuro-2a cell line. We find only a minority of lncRNAs are unstable. LncRNA half-lives vary over a wide range, comparable to, although on average less than, that of mRNAs, suggestive of complex metabolism and widespread functionality. Combining half-lives with comprehensive lncRNA annotations identified hundreds of unstable (half-life &lt; 2 h) intergenic, cis-antisense, and intronic lncRNAs, as well as lncRNAs showing extreme stability (half-life &gt; 16 h). Analysis of lncRNA features revealed that intergenic and cis-antisense RNAs are more stable than those derived from introns, as are spliced lncRNAs compared to unspliced (single exon) transcripts. Subcellular localization of lncRNAs indicated widespread trafficking to different cellular locations, with nuclear-localized lncRNAs more likely to be unstable. Surprisingly, one of the least stable lncRNAs is the well-characterized paraspeckle RNA Neat1, suggesting Neat1 instability contributes to the dynamic nature of this subnuclear domain. We have created an online interactive resource (http://stability.matticklab.com) that allows easy navigation of lncRNA and mRNA stability profiles and provides a comprehensive annotation of ~7200 mouse lncRNAs.'

aS'Xist localization and function: new insights from multiple levels.\r\nIn female mammals, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is transcriptionally silenced in order to achieve dosage compensation between the genders in a process called X chromosome inactivation. The master regulator of this process is the long non-coding RNA Xist. During X-inactivation, Xist accumulates in cis on the future inactive X chromosome, triggering a cascade of events that provoke the stable silencing of the entire chromosome, with relatively few genes remaining active. How Xist spreads, what are its binding sites, how it recruits silencing factors and how it induces a specific topological and nuclear organization of the chromatin all remain largely unanswered questions. Recent studies have improved our understanding of Xist localization and the proteins with which it interacts, allowing a reappraisal of ideas about Xist function. We discuss recent advances in our knowledge of Xist-mediated silencing, focusing on Xist spreading, the nuclear organization of the inactive X chromosome, recruitment of the polycomb complex and the role of the nuclear matrix in the process of X chromosome inactivation.'

aS'Aberrantly expressed long noncoding RNAs in human intervertebral disc degeneration: a microarray related study.\r\nINTRODUCTION: In addition to the well-known short noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), increasing evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as key regulators in a wide aspect of biologic processes. Dysregulated expression of lncRNAs has been demonstrated being implicated in a variety of human diseases. However, little is known regarding the role of lncRNAs with regards to intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). In the present study we aimed to determine whether lncRNAs are differentially expressed in IDD.METHODS: An lncRNA-mRNA microarray analysis of human nucleus pulposus (NP) was employed. Bioinformatics prediction was also applied to delineate the functional roles of the differentially expressed lncRNAs. Several lncRNAs and mRNAs were chosen for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation.RESULTS: Microarray data profiling indicated that 116 lncRNAs (67 up and 49 down) and 260 mRNAs were highly differentially expressed with an absolute fold change greater than ten. Moreover, 1,052 lncRNAs and 1,314 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the same direction in at least four of the five degenerative samples with fold change greater than two. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis for the differentially expressed mRNAs indicated a number of pathways, such as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction. A coding-noncoding gene co-expression (CNC) network was constructed for the ten most significantly changed lncRNAs. Annotation terms of the coexpressed mRNAs were related to several known degenerative alterations, such as chondrocyte differentiation. Moreover, lncRNAs belonging to a particular subgroup were identified. Functional annotation for the corresponding nearby coding genes showed that these lncRNAs were mainly associated with cell migration and phosphorylation. Interestingly, we found that Fas-associated protein factor-1 (FAF1), which potentiates the Fas-mediated apoptosis and its nearby enhancer-like lncRNA RP11-296A18.3, were highly expressed in the degenerative discs. Subsequent qRT-PCR results confirmed the changes.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs play a role in the development of IDD. Our study noted that up-regulated RP11-296A18.3 highly likely induced the over-expression of FAF1, which eventually promoted the aberrant apoptosis of disc cells. Such findings further broaden the understanding of the etiology of IDD.'

aS'Long Noncoding RNA Ceruloplasmin Promotes Cancer Growth by Altering Glycolysis.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) significantly influence the development and regulation of genome expression in cells. Here, we demonstrate the role of lncRNA ceruloplasmin (NRCP) in cancer metabolism and elucidate functional effects leading to increased tumor progression. NRCP was highly upregulated in ovarian tumors, and knockdown of NRCP resulted in significantly increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased glycolysis compared with control cancer cells. In an orthotopic mouse model of ovarian cancer, siNRCP delivered via a liposomal carrier significantly reduced tumor growth compared with control treatment. We identified NRCP as an intermediate binding partner between STAT1 and RNA polymerase II, leading to increased expression of downstream target genes such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase. Collectively, we report a previously unrecognized role of the lncRNA NRCP in modulating cancer metabolism. As demonstrated, DOPC nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA-mediated silencing of this lncRNA in vivo provides therapeutic avenue toward modulating lncRNAs in cancer.'

aS'The novel long noncoding RNA linc00467 promotes cell survival but is down-regulated by N-Myc.\r\nThe worst subtype of neuroblastoma is caused by MYCN oncogene amplification and N-Myc oncoprotein over-expression. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as critical regulators of gene expression and tumourigenesis. While Myc oncoproteins are well-known to exert tumourigenic effects by regulating the expression of protein-coding genes and microRNAs, little is known about which lncRNAs are Myc targets and whether the Myc target lncRNAs play a role in Myc-induced oncogenesis. Here we performed differential gene expression studies using lncRNA microarray in neuroblastoma cells after transfection with control or N-Myc-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), and identified N-Myc target lncRNAs including the novel lncRNA linc00467, the expression and function of which were completely unknown. RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays showed that N-Myc suppressed linc00467 gene expression through direct binding to the linc00467 gene promoter and reducing linc00467 promoter activity. While N-Myc suppressed the expression of RD3, the protein-coding gene immediately down-stream of linc00467 gene, through direct binding to the RD3 gene promoter and reducing RD3 promoter activity, linc00467 reduced RD3 mRNA expression. Moreover, Affymetrix microarray analysis revealed that one of genes significantly up-regulated by linc00467 siRNA was the tumour suppressor gene DKK1. Importantly, knocking-down linc00467 expression with siRNA in neuroblastoma cells reduced the number of viable cells and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, and co-transfection with DKK1 siRNA blocked the effects. These findings therefore demonstrate that N-Myc-mediated suppression of linc00467 gene transcription counterintuitively blocks N-Myc-mediated reduction in RD3 mRNA expression, and reduces neuroblastoma cell survival by inducing DKK1 expression.'

aS'Identification of module biomarkers from the dysregulated ceRNA-ceRNA interaction network in lung adenocarcinoma.\r\nCompetitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel layer of gene regulation that plays important roles in the physiology and development of diseases such as cancer and its dysregulation could contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Here, we have proposed a computational method to systematically identify genome-wide dysregulated ceRNA-ceRNA interactions by integrating microRNA regulation with expression profiles in cancer and normal tissues by RNA sequencing, as well as considering the details of how the behavior of ceRNAs has changed. These gain or loss dysregulations further assemble into a dysregulated ceRNA-ceRNA network; lncRNAs and pseudogenes are also considered. After applying the method to lung adenocarcinoma, we found that most dysregulations are connected together and formed a lung adenocarcinoma dysregulated ceRNA-ceRNA network (LDCCNet). Our analyses found that ceRNA pairs with gain regulations have consistent expression in cancer, otherwise for loss regulation, it is not necessary. Moreover, ceRNAs with more significant gain regulations (gain ceRNAs) undergo stronger regulation in cancer; thus their expression is more likely to decrease in cancer, while the expression of loss ceRNAs displays a rising trend. Additionally, we found that gain and loss ceRNAs as topological key nodes are implicated in the development of cancer. Finally, dysregulated ceRNA modules were identified, which are significantly enriched with known lung cancer microRNAs. We further found that several modules have the power as diagnostic biomarkers even in three independent datasets. For example, the module with lncRNA RP11-457M11.2 as a center is involved in the epithelial cell morphogenesis process and provides the average AUC values of 0.95. Our study about LDCCNet opens up the possibility of a new biological mechanism in cancer that could serve as a biomarker for diagnosis.'

aS'The KLHL1-antisense transcript ( KLHL1AS) is evolutionarily conserved.\r\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is caused by a CTG expansion in an untranslated, endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the Kelch-like 1 ( KLHL1) gene. The normal function of this transcript is currently unknown. We have now identified the promoter region for the KLHL1-antisense ( KLHL1AS) RNA and report that a Klhl1as transcript is present in the mouse as well. Human and mouse KLHL1AS are transcribed from homologous promoter regions in the first intron of KLHL1 and extend through the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of KLHL1. We found that the mouse Klhl1as RNA is not spliced and terminates in a polyadenylation site in the Klhl1 promoter region, whereas both the present and previous work show that human KLHL1AS is highly variably spliced into processed transcripts that contain up to six exons. Mouse Klhl1as transcript was detected in RNA isolated from the cerebellum and from total adult brain and total fetal tissue, and at a low level in testis and ovary. Similarly, human KLHL1AS is expressed in various brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8, and was detected at low levels in testis and kidney. The evolutionary conservation of this antisense/sense transcriptional organization strongly indicates that KLHL1AS transcripts play a significant biological role in both human and mouse, presumably as a regulator of KLHL1 expression.'

aS'Analysis of lncRNAs expression in UVB-induced stress responses of melanocytes.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have close relationships with oxidative stress, nutritional deficiency, DNA damage and other types of cellular stress responses. Previous studies have demonstrated that some non-coding RNAs in melanocytes such as microRNAs can change and contribute to the synthesis of melanin or the development of melanoma after stimulation with UV. However, as an important component of non-coding RNAs, it is unclear what changes occur in lncRNAs during UV-induced stress responses in melanocytes.OBJECTIVE: To explore changes in the expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in melanocytes following UVB-induced stress, and to explore if lncRNAs are involved in the synthesis of melanin.METHODS: Primary melanocytes were irradiated by 20mJ/cm(2) UVB. The MTT method was used to detect cell proliferation. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to analyze expression of tyrosinase (TYR) and lncRNAs. Dopa colorimetry was performed to analyze TYR activity. The expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs were confirmed using an Agilent Human lncRNA 4\xc3\x97180K chip. Intracellular ROS levels were detected by flow cytometry. ROS scavenger (NAC) was employed to inhibit the ROS level. TYR mRNA expression and activity were re-analysed after transfecting of lnc-CD1D-2:1 siRNA and lnc-SGCG-5:4 siRNA in UVB-irradiated melanocytes to confirm the roles of the two lncRNAs in the synthesis of melanin. phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, and phospho-JNK expressions were detected by Western Blot.RESULTS: Cell proliferation of the 20mJ/cm(2) UVB-irradiated melanocytes decreased to 91% of that of the control cells. Twenty-four hours after irradiation with 20mJ/cm(2) UVB, TYR mRNA expression and activity of the irradiated cells were significantly increased relative to the control group. Chip detection data showed that after irradiation with 20mJ/cm(2) UVB, the expression of 807 lncRNAs and 69 stress response-related genes had changed by more than two-fold. Expression levels of Lnc-GKN2-1:1, lnc-CD1D-2:1, and lnc-SGCG-5:4 and ROS content were significantly increased after UVB irradiation. NAC reduced UVB-induced ROS generation and inhibited UVB-induced upregulation of lnc-GKN2-1:1 and lnc-CD1D-2:1. Lnc-CD1D-2:1 siRNA significantly suppressed the UVB-induced TYR mRNA expression and tyrosinase activation. Lnc-CD1D-2:1 siRNA inhibited UVB-induced p38 phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs in melanocytes undergo significant changes following irradiation with 20mJ/cm(2) UVB, suggestting that lncRNAs participate in the UVB-induced stress response. Some lncRNAs expression changes induced by UVB are dependent on ROS generation. ROS-mediated production of lnc-CD1D-2:1 may be involved in the melanogenesis induced by UVB.'

aS'TINCR, staufen1, and cellular differentiation.\r\nThe human genome encodes several thousand long non-protein coding transcripts&gt;200 nucleotides in length, a subset of which were shown to play important roles in regulation of gene expression. We recently identified TINCR, a lncRNA required for induction of key differentiation genes in epidermal tissue, including genes mutated in human skin diseases characterized by disrupted epidermal barrier formation. High-throughput analyses of TINCR RNA- and protein-interactomes revealed TINCR interaction with differentiation mRNAs as well as the Staufen1 protein. TINCR, together with Staufen1, seems to stabilize a subset of mRNAs required for epidermal differentiation. Here, we discuss the emerging roles of Staufen1 and TINCR in the regulation of mammalian cell differentiation mediated by interaction with target mRNAs. We consider a role for TINCR as an epithelial-specific guide for targeting the Staufen1 protein to specific mRNAs, reflecting the increasing complexity of gene regulatory processes in mammalian cells and tissue.'

aS'Identification of an imprinting control region affecting the expression of all transcripts in the Gnas cluster.\r\nGenomic imprinting results in allele-specific silencing according to parental origin. Silencing is brought about by imprinting control regions (ICRs) that are differentially marked in gametogenesis. The group of imprinted transcripts in the mouse Gnas cluster (Nesp, Nespas, Gnasxl, Exon 1A and Gnas) provides a model for analyzing the mechanisms of imprint regulation. We previously identified an ICR that specifically regulates the tissue-specific imprinted expression of the Gnas gene. Here we identify a second ICR at the Gnas cluster. We show that a paternally derived targeted deletion of the germline differentially methylated region (DMR) associated with the antisense Nespas transcript unexpectedly affects both the expression of all transcripts in the cluster and methylation of two DMRs. Our results establish that the Nespas DMR is the principal ICR at the Gnas cluster and functions bidirectionally as a switch for modulating expression of the antagonistically acting genes Gnasxl and Gnas. Uniquely, the Nespas DMR acts on the downstream ICR at exon 1A to regulate tissue-specific imprinting of the Gnas gene.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA HIF1A-AS1A reduces apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells: implications for the pathogenesis of thoracoabdominal aorta aneurysm.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) play important roles in various biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, cell growth and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the role of IncRNA HIF 1 alpha-antisense RNA 1 (HIF1a-AS1) in regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and the expression of HIF1a-AS1 in serum of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) patients. The cell viability was detected by the CCK8 assay. The cell apoptosis was assessed by annexin V-PI double-labeling staining. Expression of genes and proteins were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Cells were transfected with siRNAs as a gene silencing method. In serum of TAAA patients, the expression of HIF1a-AS1 was significantly increased (superior to 6-fold) compared to the normal control. Moreover, Palmitic acid (PA) induced cell apoptosis in VSMCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and the proportion of the apoptotic cells had gained as compared to untreatment group. PA also induced up-regulation expression of HIF1a-AS1. We also found that transfection of cells with HIF1a-AS1 siRNA decreased the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8 and increased the expression of Bcl2, and protected PA-induced cell apoptosis in VSMCs. HIF1a-AS1 was overexpressed in the TAAA and the interaction between HIF1a-AS1 and apoptotic proteins plays a key role in the proliferation and apoptosis of VSMCs in vitro, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of TAAA.'

aS'Differentiation-dependent requirement of Tsix long non-coding RNA in imprinted X-chromosome inactivation.\r\nImprinted X-inactivation is a paradigm of mammalian transgenerational epigenetic regulation resulting in silencing of genes on the paternally inherited X-chromosome. The preprogrammed fate of the X-chromosomes is thought to be controlled in cis by the parent-of-origin-specific expression of two opposing long non-coding RNAs, Tsix and Xist, in mice. Exclusive expression of Tsix from the maternal-X has implicated it as the instrument through which the maternal germline prevents inactivation of the maternal-X in the offspring. Here, we show that Tsix is dispensable for inhibiting Xist and X-inactivation in the early embryo and in cultured stem cells of extra-embryonic lineages. Tsix is instead required to prevent Xist expression as trophectodermal progenitor cells differentiate. Despite induction of wild-type Xist RNA and accumulation of histone H3-K27me3, many Tsix-mutant X-chromosomes fail to undergo ectopic X-inactivation. We propose a novel model of lncRNA function in imprinted X-inactivation that may also apply to other genomically imprinted loci.'

aS'Genome-wide DNA methylome analysis reveals epigenetically dysregulated non-coding RNAs in human breast cancer.\r\nDespite growing appreciation of the importance of epigenetics in breast cancer, our understanding of epigenetic alterations of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in breast cancer remains limited. Here, we explored the epigenetic patterns of ncRNAs in breast cancers using published sequencing-based methylome data, primarily focusing on the two most commonly studied ncRNA biotypes, long ncRNAs and miRNAs. We observed widely aberrant methylation in the promoters of ncRNAs, and this abnormal methylation was more frequent than that in protein-coding genes. Specifically, intergenic ncRNAs were observed to comprise a majority (51.45% of the lncRNAs and 51.57% of the miRNAs) of the aberrantly methylated ncRNA promoters. Moreover, we summarized five patterns of aberrant ncRNA promoter methylation in the context of genomic CpG islands (CGIs), in which aberrant methylation occurred not only on CGIs, but also in regions flanking CGI and in CGI-lacking promoters. Integration with transcriptional datasets enabled us to determine that the ncRNA promoter methylation events were associated with transcriptional changes. Furthermore, a panel of ncRNAs were identified as biomarkers that discriminated between disease phenotypes. Finally, the potential functions of aberrantly methylated ncRNAs were predicted, suggestiong that ncRNAs and coding genes cooperatively mediate pathway dysregulation during the development and progression of breast cancer.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA BANCR regulates growth and metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in retinoblastoma.\r\nRecent evidence shows that BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) acts as a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis in malignant melanoma and lung cancer; however, little is known about the significance of lncRNA BANCR in retinoblastoma. The purpose of our study is to explore the role of lncRNA BANCR in retinoblastoma clinical samples and cell lines. The expression of lncRNA BANCR was measured in 60 retinoblastoma samples and normal retina samples by using RT-PCR. The effects of lncRNA BANCR on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were also explored. In our results, lncRNA BANCR is overexpressed in retinoblastoma tissues and cell lines and is associated with tumor size, choroidal invasion, and optic nerve invasion. Moreover, patients with high levels of lncRNA BANCR expression had poorer survival than those with lower levels of lncRNA BANCR expression. Multivariate analysis showed that increased lncRNA BANCR expression was a poor independent prognostic factor for retinoblastoma patients. Furthermore, knocking down lncRNA BANCR expression significantly suppressed the retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In conclusion, lncRNA BANCR plays a significant role in retinoblastoma aggressiveness and prognosis and may act as a promising target for therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction.'

aS'Prognostic and predictive values of long non-coding RNA LINC00472 in breast cancer.\r\nLINC00472 is a novel long intergenic non-coding RNA. We evaluated LINC00472 expression in breast tumor samples using RT-qPCR, performed a meta-analysis of over 20 microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and investigated the effect of LINC00472 expression on cell proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells transfected with a LINC00472-expressing vector. Our qPCR results showed that high LINC00472 expression was associated with less aggressive breast tumors and more favorable disease outcomes. Patients with high expression of LINC00472 had significantly reduced risk of relapse and death compared to those with low expression. Patients with high LINC00472 expression also had better responses to adjuvant chemo- or hormonal therapy than did patients with low expression. Results of meta-analysis on multiple studies from the GEO database were in agreement with the findings of our study. High LINC00472 was also associated with favorable molecular subtypes, Luminal A or normal-like tumors. Cell culture experiments showed that up-regulation of LINC00472 expression could suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our clinical and in vitro studies suggest that LINC00472 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Evaluating this long non-coding RNA in breast tumors may have prognostic and predictive value in the clinical management of breast cancer.'

aS'Investigation of long noncoding RNAs expression profile as potential serum biomarkers in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nThere is an increasing interest in using long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as biomarkers in cancer. Predictive biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have great benefit in the choice of therapeutic modality for HCC. The aim of this study is to assess lncRNA-urothelial carcinoma associated-1 (lncRNA-UCA1) and WD repeat containing, antisense to TP53 (WRAP53) expression as novel noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis of HCC in sera of HCC patients compared with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients and healthy volunteers and to analyze their relationship with respect to the clinicopathologic features. We retrieved HCC characteristic lncRNAs, lncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53, based on the microarray signature profiling (released by LncRNADisease database). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-qPCR) was then used to evaluate the expression of selected lncRNAs in the serum of 160 participants. Furthermore, in 20 of 82 HCC cases involved in the study, we examined the expression of lncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53 in 20 HCC tissues and adjacent nontumor tissues and analyzed its correlation with the serum level of these lncRNAs. The prognostic significance of the investigated parameters in HCC patients was explored. We found that lncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53 were significantly higher in sera of HCC than those with chronic HCV infection or healthy volunteers. Our data suggested that the increased expression of UCA1 and WRAP53 was associated with advanced clinical parameters in HCC. Of note, tissue levels of the chosen lncRNAs strongly correlate with their sera level. The combination of both lncRNAs with serum alpha fetoprotein resulted in improved sensitivity to 100%. The median follow-up period was 21.5\xc2\xa0months. LncRNA-WRAP53 was significant independent prognostic markers in relapse-free survival. LncRNA-UCA1 and lncRNA-WRAP53 upregulation may serve as novel serum biomarkers for HCC diagnosis and prognosis.'

aS'A distinct set of long non-coding RNAs in childhood MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia: biology and epigenetic target.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently found to be pervasively transcribed in human genome and link to diverse human diseases. However, the expression patterns and regulatory roles of lncRNAs in hematopoietic malignancies have not been reported. Here, we carried out a genome-wide lncRNA expression study in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MLL-r ALL) and established lncRNA/messenger RNA coexpression networks to gain insight into the biological roles of these dysregulated lncRNAs. We detected a number of lncRNAs that were differentially expressed in MLL-r ALL samples compared with MLL-r wild-type and identified unique lncRNA expression patterns between MLL-r subtypes with different translocations as well as between infant MLL-r ALL with other MLL-r ALL patients, suggesting that they might be served as novel biomarkers for the disease. Importantly, several lncRNAs that correspond with membrane protein genes, including a lysosome-associated membrane protein, were identified. No such link between the membrane proteins and MLL-r leukemia has been reported previously. Impressively, the functional analysis showed that several lncRNAs corresponded to the expression of MLL-fusion protein target genes, including HOXA9, MEIS1, etc., while some other associated with histone-related functions or membrane proteins. Further experiments characterize the effect of some lncRNAs on MLL-r leukemia apoptosis and proliferation as the function of the coexpressed HOXA gene cluster. Finally, a set of lncRNAs epigenetically regulated by H3K79 methylation were also discovered. These findings may provide novel insights into the mechanisms of lncRNAs involved in the initiation of MLL-r leukemia. This is the first study linking lncRNAs to leukemogenesis.'

aS'Intergenic transcription and transinduction of the human beta-globin locus.\r\nWe have identified novel nuclear transcripts in the human beta-globin locus using nuclear run-on analysis in erythroid cell lines and in situ hybridization analysis of erythroid tissue. These transcripts extend across the LCR and intergenic regions but are undetectable in nonerythroid cells. Surprisingly, transient transfection of a beta-globin gene (epsilon, gamma, or beta) induces transcription of the LCR and intergenic regions from the chromosomal beta-globin locus in nonerythroid cell lines. The beta-globin genes themselves, however, remain transcriptionally silent. Induction is dependent on transcription of the globin gene in the transfected plasmid but does not require protein expression. Using in situ hybridization analysis, we show that the plasmid colocalizes with the endogenous beta-globin locus providing insight into the mechanism of transinduction.'

aS'Expression and prognostic impact of lncRNAs in acute myeloid leukemia.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, located within the intergenic stretches or overlapping antisense transcripts of protein coding genes. LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged \xe2\x89\xa560 y) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform. An independent set of 71 untreated older patients with CN-AML was used to validate the outcome scores using RNA sequencing. Distinctive lncRNA profiles were found associated with selected mutations, such as internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, IDH2, ASXL1, and RUNX1 genes. Using the lncRNAs most associated with event-free survival in a training cohort of 148 older patients with CN-AML, we derived a lncRNA score composed of 48 lncRNAs. Patients with an unfavorable compared with favorable lncRNA score had a lower complete response (CR) rate [P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio = 0.14, 54% vs. 89%], shorter disease-free survival (DFS) [P &lt; 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88] and overall survival (OS) (P &lt; 0.001, HR = 2.95). The validation set analyses confirmed these results (CR, P = 0.03; DFS, P = 0.009; OS, P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses for CR, DFS, and OS identified the lncRNA score as an independent marker for outcome. In conclusion, lncRNA expression in AML is closely associated with recurrent mutations. A small subset of lncRNAs is correlated strongly with treatment response and survival.'

aS'Small noncoding differentially methylated copy-number variants, including lncRNA genes, cause a lethal lung developmental disorder.\r\nAn unanticipated and tremendous amount of the noncoding sequence of the human genome is transcribed. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a significant fraction of non-protein-coding transcripts; however, their functions remain enigmatic. We demonstrate that deletions of a small noncoding differentially methylated region at 16q24.1, including lncRNA genes, cause a lethal lung developmental disorder, alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACD/MPV), with parent-of-origin effects. We identify overlapping deletions 250 kb upstream of FOXF1 in nine patients with ACD/MPV that arose de novo specifically on the maternally inherited chromosome and delete lung-specific lncRNA genes. These deletions define a distant cis-regulatory region that harbors, besides lncRNA genes, also a differentially methylated CpG island, binds GLI2 depending on the methylation status of this CpG island, and physically interacts with and up-regulates the FOXF1 promoter. We suggest that lung-transcribed 16q24.1 lncRNAs may contribute to long-range regulation of FOXF1 by GLI2 and other transcription factors. Perturbation of lncRNA-mediated chromatin interactions may, in general, be responsible for position effect phenomena and potentially cause many disorders of human development.'

aS'Novel insights into a treatment for aplastic anemia based on the advanced proliferation of bone marrow\xe2\x80\x91derived mesenchymal stem cells induced by fibroblast growth factor\xc2\xa01.\r\nAplastic anemia (AA) is rare disease that is predominantly observed in adolescents. Without effective management at an early stage, is associated with a high risk of mortality. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into various types of cell, which are able to produce a number of hematopoietic growth factors considered to be important in AA alleviation. However, the mechanism underlying the role of fibroblast growth factor\xc2\xa01 (FGF1) in BMSC differentiation remains unknown. In the current study, the investigation focused on the regulatory role and potential signaling pathway of FGF1 in BMSC differentiation in patients exhibiting AA. BMSCs were infected with Ad\xe2\x80\x91FGF1 and presented a potent proliferation capability, which was evaluated using Cell Counting kit\xe2\x80\x918 analysis. Reverse transcription\xe2\x80\x91quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that long non\xe2\x80\x91coding (lnc)RNA of testis development related gene\xc2\xa01 (TDRG1) was significantly upregulated, demonstrating high expression at the transcriptional level in the BMSCs that were infected with Ad\xe2\x80\x91FGF1. The decreased proliferation capability of BMSCs that were treated with Ad\xe2\x80\x91FGF1 and TDRG1\xe2\x80\x91small interfering\xc2\xa0RNA validated the vital effect of TDRG1 on the FGF1 regulatory process of BMSC differentiation. Further experiments revealed that the increase of acetyl\xe2\x80\x91histones, H3 and H4 was diminished in the TDRG1 promoter of BMSCs that were infected with Ad\xe2\x80\x91FGF1, which indicated that the process of acetylation was promoted when the BMSCs were infected with Ad-FGF1. Thus, it was inferred that FGF1 induces the proliferation of BMSCs in patients with AA via promoting acetylation in lncRNA of the TDRG1 gene promoter.'

aS'Hoxa 11 structure, extensive antisense transcription, and function in male and female fertility.\r\nHoxa 11 is a murine Abdominal-B-type homeobox gene. The structure of this gene is presented, including genomic and cDNA sequence. The cDNA includes the complete open reading frame and based on primer extension results is near full length. Surprisingly, the antisense strand of Hoxa 11 was found to be transcribed. Moreover, these antisense transcripts were processed and polyadenylated. The developmental expression patterns for both sense and antisense transcripts were examined using serial section and whole-mount in situ hybridizations. Hoxa 11 transcription patterns were defined in the limbs, kidney and stromal cells surrounding the Mullerian and Wolffian ducts. Of particular interest, in the developing limbs, the sense and antisense transcripts showed complementary expression patterns, with antisense RNAs increasing in abundance in regions where sense RNAs were diminishing in abundance. Furthermore, targeted mutation of Hoxa 11 is shown to result in both male and female sterility. The female mutants produce normal ova, which develop properly post-fertilization when transferred to wild-type surrogate mothers. The Hoxa 11 homozygous mutants are shown to provide a defective uterine environment. The mutant males exhibited a malformation of the vas deferens that resembles a partial homeotic transformation to an epididymis. In addition, the mutant testes fail to descend properly into the scrotum and, likely as a result, spermatogenesis is perturbed.'

aS"Long noncoding RNAs: Re-writing dogmas of RNA processing and stability.\r\nMost of the human genome is transcribed, yielding a complex network of transcripts that includes tens of thousands of long noncoding RNAs. Many of these transcripts have a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail, yet some of the most abundant long noncoding RNAs are processed in unexpected ways and lack these canonical structures. Here, I highlight the mechanisms by which several of these well-characterized noncoding RNAs are generated, stabilized, and function. The MALAT1 and MEN \xce\xb2 (NEAT1_2) long noncoding RNAs each accumulate to high levels in the nucleus, where they play critical roles in cancer progression and the formation of nuclear paraspeckles, respectively. Nevertheless, MALAT1 and MEN \xce\xb2 are not polyadenylated as the tRNA biogenesis machinery generates their mature 3' ends. In place of a poly(A) tail, these transcripts are stabilized by highly conserved triple helical structures. Sno-lncRNAs likewise lack poly(A) tails and instead have snoRNA structures at their 5' and 3' ends. Recent work has additionally identified a number of abundant circular RNAs generated by the pre-mRNA splicing machinery that are resistant to degradation by exonucleases. As these various transcripts use non-canonical strategies to ensure their stability, it is becoming increasingly clear that long noncoding RNAs may often be regulated by unique post-transcriptional control mechanisms.

aS'BCYRN1, a c-MYC-activated long non-coding RNA, regulates cell metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly implicated in the regulation of the progression of malignancy.AIM: To clarify the relations among BCYRN1 (brain cytoplasmic RNA 1, a long non-coding RNA), c-MYC and cell metastasis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).METHODS: Real-time PCR was used to measure expression of BCYRN1 in NSCLC. Knockdown and overexpression of c-MYC were respectively performed using shRNA and lentivirus to investigate its effect on BCYRN1 expression. BCYRN1 was respectively knockdown and overexpressed by siRNA and BCYRN1 mimics to investigate its role in regulating cell metastasis in vitro. ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay was performed to confirm the binding of c-MYC to the promoter of BCYRN1. Expression levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9 and MMP13) were determined using real-time PCR and Western blotting.RESULTS: BCYRN1 is upregulated and targeted by c-MYC in NSCLC, leading to the increase of cell motility and invasiveness. RNA interference and lentivirus infection showed a positive correlation between the expressions of c-MYC and BCYRN1. ChIP assay confirmed the binding of c-MYC to the promoter region of BCYRN1 gene. In-vitro cell metastasis experiments demonstrated that BCYRN1 was necessary in the c-MYC-regulated cell migration and invasion. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP9 and MMP13 descended with the decreasing BCYRN1 level and ascended with the upregulation of BCYRN1.CONCLUSION: These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism in NSCLC cells involving the metastasis-promoting lncRNA BCYRN1 that improves expressions of the key metastasis-supporting proteins MMP9 and MMP13.'

aS'Competing endogenous RNA networks and gastric cancer.\r\nRecent studies have showed that RNAs regulate each other with microRNA (miRNA) response elements (MREs) and this mechanism is known as "competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)" hypothesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are supposed to play important roles in cancer. Compelling evidence suggests that lncRNAs can interact with miRNAs and regulate the expression of miRNAs as ceRNAs. Several lncRNAs such as H19, HOTAIR and MEG3 have been found to be associated with miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC), generating regulatory crosstalk across the transcriptome. These MRE sharing elements implicated in the ceRNA networks (ceRNETs) are able to regulate mRNA expression. The ceRNA regulatory networks including mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs and circular RNAs may play critical roles in tumorigenesis, and the perturbations of ceRNETs may contribute to the pathogenesis of GC.'

aS'The association analysis of lncRNA HOTAIR genetic variants and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.\r\nThe HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a well-known long noncoding RNA, is involved in pathogenesis and progress of multiple tumors. Its ectopic expression and biological functions have been observed in gastric cancer. In this study, we conducted a two-stage case-control study to evaluate whether genetic variations of HOTAIR were associated with gastric cancer risk. We identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4759314 was significantly associated with the increased gastric cancer risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-1.71, P = 0.002] in the combined sets. Further functional experiments revealed the allele-specific effects on HOTAIR and HOXC11 expressions in gastric cancer tissues, of which HOTAIR and HOXC11 expressions of individuals carrying with AG genotype were much higher than those with AA genotype; similarly, the effects occurred in intronic promoter activities, of which the promoter activity of G allele was more pronounced than that of A allele. Interestingly, we identified a novel potential oncogene HOXC11 in gastric cancer pathogenesis with differential expression in gastric cancer tissues by association analysis with candidate gene strategy. These results suggest that SNP rs4759314 of HOTAIR acts as a potential biomarker for predicting gastric cancer, and the role of HOXC11 in gastric cancer etiology is warranted to further investigation.'

aS'Expression profile of long non-coding RNAs in pancreatic cancer and their clinical significance as biomarkers.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have shown great potential as powerful and non-invasive tumor markers. However, little is known about their value as biomarkers in pancreatic cancer (PC). We applied an Arraystar Human LncRNA Microarray which targeting 7419 lncRNAs to determine the lncRNA expression profile in PC and to screen the potential biomarkers. The most increased lncRNAs in PC tissues were HOTTIP-005, XLOC_006390, and RP11-567G11.1. Increased HOTTIP-005 and RP11-567G11.1 expression were poor prognostic factors for patients with PC (n = 144, p &lt; 0.0001). The expression patterns of HOTTIP splice variants in PC were also detected. HOTTIP-005 and HOTTIP-001 were the first and second most increased HOTTIP splice variants, respectively. Plasma HDRF and RDRF (HOTTIP-005 and RP11-567G11.1 derived RNA fragments in plasma/serum) were present in stable form. Their levels were significantly increased in the patients with PC as compared to the healthy controls (n = 127 and 122 respectively, p &lt; 0.0001) and the high levels were derived from PC. HDRF and RDRF levels are promising indicators for distinguishing patients with PC from those without PC. This study identified HOTTIP-005 and RP11-567G11.1 and their plasma fragments with the potential to be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of PC. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.'

aS"Identification of long noncoding RNAs dysregulated in the midbrain of human cocaine abusers.\r\nMaintenance of the drug-addicted state is thought to involve changes in gene expression in different neuronal cell types and neural circuits. Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in particular mediate numerous responses to drugs of abuse. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate CNS gene expression through a variety of mechanisms, but next to nothing is known about their role in drug abuse. The proportion of lncRNAs that are primate-specific provides a strong rationale for their study in human drug abusers. In this study, we determined a profile of dysregulated putative lncRNAs through the analysis of postmortem human midbrain specimens from chronic cocaine abusers and well-matched control subjects (n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa011 in each group) using a custom lncRNA microarray. A dataset comprising 32 well-annotated lncRNAs with independent evidence of brain expression and robust differential expression in cocaine abusers is presented. For a subset of these lncRNAs, differential expression was validated by quantitative real-time PCR and cellular localization determined by in\xc2\xa0situ hybridization histochemistry. Examples of lncRNAs exhibiting DA cell-specific expression, different subcellular distributions, and covariance of expression with known cocaine-regulated protein-coding genes were identified. These findings implicate lncRNAs in the cellular responses of human DA neurons to chronic cocaine abuse. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, but little is known about their potential role in drug abuse. In this study, we identified lncRNAs differentially expressed in human cocaine abusers' midbrains. One up-regulated antisense lncRNA, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3-interacting protein 2-antisense 1 (TRAF3IP2-AS1), was found predominantly in the nucleus of human dopamine (DA) neurons, whereas the related TRAF3IP2 protein-coding transcript was distributed throughout these cells. The abundances of these transcripts were significantly correlated (left) suggesting that TRAF3IP2-AS1 may regulate TRAF3IP2 gene expression, perhaps through local chromatin changes at this locus (right)."

aS'Influence of MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1 Genetic Polymorphisms on Body Mass Index in Psychiatric Patients and In Population-Based Subjects with Present or Past Atypical Depression.\r\nObesity development during psychotropic treatments represents a major health issue in psychiatry. Melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (MCHR2) is a central receptor involved in energy homeostasis. MCHR2 shares its promoter region with MCHR2-AS1, a long antisense non-coding RNA. The aim of this study was to determine whether tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1 are associated with the body mass index (BMI) in the psychiatric and in the general population. The influence of MCHR2 and MCHR2-AS1 tSNPs on BMI was firstly investigated in a discovery psychiatric sample (n1 = 474). Positive results were tested for replication in two other psychiatric samples (n2 = 164, n3 = 178) and in two population-based samples (CoLaus, n4 = 5409; GIANT, n5 = 113809). In the discovery sample, TT carriers of rs7754794C&gt;T had 1.08 kg/m2 (p = 0.04) lower BMI as compared to C-allele carriers. This observation was replicated in an independent psychiatric sample (-2.18 kg/m2; p = 0.009). The association of rs7754794C&gt;T and BMI seemed stronger in subjects younger than 45 years (median of age). In the population-based sample, a moderate association was observed (-0.17 kg/m2; p = 0.02) among younger individuals (&lt;45y). Interestingly, this association was totally driven by patients meeting lifetime criteria for atypical depression, i.e. major depressive episodes characterized by symptoms such as an increased appetite. Indeed, patients with atypical depression carrying rs7754794-TT had 1.17 kg/m2 (p = 0.04) lower BMI values as compared to C-allele carriers, the effect being stronger in younger individuals (-2.50 kg/m2; p = 0.03; interaction between rs7754794 and age: p-value = 0.08). This study provides new insights on the possible influence of MCHR2 and/or MCHR2-AS1 on obesity in psychiatric patients and on the pathophysiology of atypical depression.'

aS'Downregulation of long noncoding RNA NONHSAT037832 in papillary thyroid carcinoma and its clinical significance.\r\nLong noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a kind of RNA that is longer than 200 nucleotides with limited or no protein-coding potential. Studies have proved that lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in gene expression and contribute to oncogenesis and cancer metastasis. However, the expression level of lncRNAs and their clinicopathologic significance in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have not been well studied. In this study, we investigated the expression level of a novel lncRNA NONHSAT037832 in PTC and paired noncancerous thyroid tissues as well as some cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The association between the expression level of NONHSAT037832 and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with PTC was further analyzed. Three receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were established to evaluate the diagnostic value of NONHSAT037832. The results suggested that the expression level of NONHSAT037832 was significantly decreased in PTC compared with paired noncancerous tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01). And, NONHSAT037832 was also significantly downregulated in two PTC cell lines (K1 and IHH-4) compared to normal thyroid follicular epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01). Downregulated NONHSAT037832 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.015) and tumor size (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.032). The ROCs revealed that NONHSAT037832 had a high diagnostic value for differentiating between PTC and noncancerous diseases as well as identifying PTC with lymph node metastasis and larger tumors (\xe2\x89\xa53\xc2\xa0cm). The area under curve was up to 0.897 (95%CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.852-0.942, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.000), 0.641 (95%CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.519-0.762, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.033), and 0.702 (95%CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.567-0.827, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.008), respectively. This study indicated that NONHSAT037832 might serve as a potential biomarker of PTC.'

aS'A catalogue of novel bovine long noncoding RNA across 18 tissues.\r\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) have been implicated in diverse biological roles including gene regulation and genomic imprinting. Identifying lncRNA in bovine across many differing tissue would contribute to the current repertoire of bovine lncRNA, and help further improve our understanding of the evolutionary importance and constraints of these transcripts. Additionally, it could aid in identifying sites in the genome outside of protein coding genes where mutations could contribute to variation in complex traits. This is particularly important in bovine as genomic predictions are increasingly used in genetic improvement for milk and meat production. Our aim was to identify and annotate novel long non coding RNA transcripts in the bovine genome captured from RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data across 18 tissues, sampled in triplicate from a single cow. To address the main challenge in identifying lncRNA, namely distinguishing lncRNA transcripts from unannotated genes and protein coding genes, a lncRNA identification pipeline with a number of filtering steps was developed. A total of 9,778 transcripts passed the filtering pipeline. The bovine lncRNA catalogue includes MALAT1 and HOTAIR, both of which have been well described in human and mouse genomes. We attempted to validate the lncRNA in libraries from three additional cows. 726 (87.47%) liver and 1,668 (55.27%) blood class 3 lncRNA were validated with stranded liver and blood libraries respectively. Additionally, this study identified a large number of novel unknown transcripts in the bovine genome with high protein coding potential, illustrating a clear need for better annotations of protein coding genes.'

aS'Coordinated expression of ncRNAs and HOX mRNAs in the human HOXA locus.\r\nIn the human HOXA locus a number of ncRNAs are transcribed from the intergenic regions in the opposite direction to HOXA mRNAs. We observed that the genomic organization of genes for the ncRNAs and HOXA proteins is highly conserved between human and mouse. We examined the expression profiles of these ncRNAs and HOXA mRNAs in various human tissues. The expression patterns of ncRNAs in human tissues coincide with those of the adjacent HOXA mRNAs that are collinearly expressed along the anteroposterior axis. This coordinated expression was observed even in transformed tumors and cancer cell lines, suggesting that the expression of ncRNAs is prerequisite for the regulated expression of HOXA genes. HIT18844 ncRNA transcribed from the most upstream position of the HOXA cluster possesses an ultra-conserved short stretch which potentially forms an evolutionarily conserved secondary structure. Our data suggest a critical role for ncRNAs in the regulation of HOXA gene expression.'

aS'Reciprocal repression between TUSC7 and miR-23b in gastric cancer.\r\nRecently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play important regulatory roles in biological processes and cancer biology. However, the overall pathophysiological contribution of lncRNAs to gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. In this study, differentially expressed lncRNAs in GC and paired adjacent normal tissue samples were identified by microarray and were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). One particular lncRNA, tumour suppressor candidate 7 (TUSC7), was analyzed in sequential large cohorts, and the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test for comparisons was used to analyse the survival data. The results indicated that TUSC7 was downregulated in GC samples and was an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in GC patients. Applying loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we determined that TUSC7 suppressed tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that TUSC7 was a direct transcriptional target of p53 via interaction of p53 with the putative p53-response element in the upstream region of TUSC7. Finally, we demonstrated reciprocal repression between TUSC7 and miR-23b; in contrast to TUSC7, miR-23b promoted cell growth. The results indicated that TUSC7 is a p53-regulated tumour suppressor that acts in part by repressing miR-23b and that TUSC7 may be a key regulatory hub in GC.'

aS'Argonaute 2 sustains the gene expression program driving human monocytic differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells.\r\nMicroRNAs are key regulators of many biological processes, including cell differentiation. These small RNAs exert their function assembled in the RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs), where members of Argonaute (Ago) family of proteins provide a unique platform for target recognition and gene silencing. Here, by using myeloid cell lines and primary blasts, we show that Ago2 has a key role in human monocytic cell fate determination and in LPS-induced inflammatory response of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3)-treated myeloid cells. The silencing of Ago2 impairs the D3-dependent miR-17-5p/20a/106a, miR-125b and miR-155 downregulation, the accumulation of their translational targets AML1, VDR and C/EBP\xce\xb2 and monocytic cell differentiation. Moreover, we show that Ago2 is recruited on miR-155 host gene promoter and on the upstream region of an overlapping antisense lncRNA, determining their epigenetic silencing, and miR-155 downregulation. These findings highlight Ago2 as a new factor in myeloid cell fate determination in acute myeloid leukemia cells.'

aS'Increased expression of long noncoding RNA ABHD11-AS1  in gastric cancer and its clinical significance.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in basic physiological processes, also affect tumor occurrence and development. However, there are still many unknown relationships between the lncRNA expression levels and gastric tumor process. In our study, we selected ABHD11 Antisense RNA 1 (ABHD11-AS1) as a representative lncRNAs to study the different expression levels between gastric tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. At the same time, we analyzed the relationship between the expression levels of ABHD11-AS1 in gastric cancer tissues and the clinicopathological features of patients with gastric cancer and evaluated the diagnostic value through the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve. Results show that compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues the expression level of ABHD11-AS1 in gastric cancer tissues was significantly increased (P = 0.027). The expression level was also significantly related with the differentiation (P = 0.022), Lauren histologic classification (P = 0.004) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (P = 0.007), and the area under ROC curve was up to 0.613. Thus, ABHD11-AS1 might be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of gastric cancer.'

aS'Identification of chimeric TSNAX-DISC1 resulting from intergenic splicing in endometrial carcinoma through high-throughput RNA sequencing.\r\nGene fusion is among the primary processes that generate new genes and has been well characterized as potent pathway of oncogenesis. Here, by high-throughput RNA sequencing in nine paired human endometrial carcinoma (EC) and matched non-cancerous tissues, we obtained that chimeric translin-associated factor X-disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (TSNAX-DISC1) occurred significantly upregulated in multiple EC samples. Experimental investigation showed that TSNAX-DISC1 appears to be formed by splicing without chromosomal rearrangement. The chimera expression inversely correlated with the binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to the insulators. Subsequent investigations indicate that long intergenic non-coding RNA lincRNA-NR_034037, separating TSNAX from DISC1, regulates TSNAX -DISC1 production and TSNAX/DISC1 expression levels by extricating CTCF from insulators. Dysregulation of TSNAX influences steroidogenic factor-1-stimulated transcription on the StAR promoter, altering progesterone actions, implying the association with cancer. Together, these results advance our understanding of the mechanism in which lincRNA-NR_034037 regulates TSNAX-DISC1 formation programs that tightly regulate EC development.'

aS"Role of Pnn in alternative splicing of a specific subset of lncRNAs of the corneal epithelium.\r\nPURPOSE: GG-H whole transcriptome array analysis suggested involvement of PININ (PNN) in the alternative splicing of multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). To further investigate PNN's role in regulating the alternative splicing of lncRNAs in a corneal epithelial context, we performed detailed analyses for detecting and identifying alternatively spliced lncRNAs.METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from PNN knockdown human corneal epithelial (HCET) cells or Pnn-deficient mouse corneas, and subjected to real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) assays, and the alternatively spliced lncRNAs were counted. Alternatively spliced lncRNAs were detected with in situ hybridization with variant-specific RNA probes on human cornea sections.RESULTS: Our analysis uncovered PNN's impact on the transcript levels of several lncRNAs including Linc00085 and HAS2-AS1. Interestingly, a mouse ortholog of HAS2-AS1, Has2as, clearly exhibited a differential splicing pattern among three major splice variants in the Pnn-deficient mouse cornea. The sequence analyses and quantification of splice variants of candidate lncRNAs, including RP11-295B20.2, RP11-18I14.1, and RP11-322M19.1, demonstrated complex configuration of their splicing changes, with a significant impact of PNN on the process. Knockdown of PNN in HCET cells led to specific changes in the inclusion of multiple cassette exons as well as in the use of alternative splice sites in RP11-322M19.1 and RP11-18I14.1, resulting in considerable net changes in the ratio between the splice variants. Finally, in situ hybridization analyses revealed the presence of RP11-295G20.2 in the nuclei of corneal epithelial cells, but not in the stromal cells of the human cornea, while RP11-322M19.1 was present in epithelial and non-epithelial cells.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest PNN's role in the alternative splicing of a specific subset of lncRNAs might have a significant impact on the corneal epithelium."

aS"The lncRNA SLNCR1 Mediates Melanoma Invasion through a Conserved SRA1-like Region.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in numerous physiological processes and diseases, most notably cancers. However, little is known about the mechanism of many functional lncRNAs. We identified an abundantly expressed lncRNA associated with decreased melanoma patient survival. Increased expression of this lncRNA, SLNCR1, mediates melanoma invasion through a highly conserved sequence similar to that of the lncRNA SRA1. Using a sensitive technique we term RATA (RNA-associated transcription factor array), we show that the brain-specific homeobox protein 3a (Brn3a) and the androgen receptor (AR) bind within and adjacent to SLNCR1's conserved region, respectively. SLNCR1, AR, and Brn3a are specifically required for transcriptional activation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and increased melanoma invasion. Our observations directly link AR to melanoma invasion, possibly explaining why males experience more melanoma metastases and have an overall lower survival in comparison to females."

aS'Development of cytotoxicity-sensitive human cells using overexpression of long non-coding RNAs.\r\nBiosensors using live cells are analytical devices that have the advantage of being highly sensitive for their targets. Although attention has primarily focused on reporter gene assays using functional promoters, cell viability assays are still efficient. We focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are involved in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to cellular stresses as a new biological material. Here we have developed human live cells transfected with lncRNAs that can be used as an intelligent sensor of cytotoxicity for a broad range of environmental stresses. We identified three lncRNAs (GAS5, IDI2-AS1, and SNHG15) that responded to cycloheximide in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of these lncRNAs sensitized human cells to cell death in response to various stresses (cycloheximide, ultraviolet irradiation, mercury II chloride, or hydrogen peroxide). In particular, dual lncRNA (GAS5 plus IDI2-AS1, or GAS5 plus SNHG15) overexpression sensitized cells to cell death by more cellular stresses. We propose a method for highly sensitive biosensors using overexpression of lncRNAs that can potentially measure the cytotoxicity signals of various environmental stresses.'

aS'Evf2 lncRNA/BRG1/DLX1 interactions reveal RNA-dependent inhibition of chromatin remodeling.\r\nTranscription-regulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have the potential to control the site-specific expression of thousands of target genes. Previously, we showed that Evf2, the first described ultraconserved lncRNA, increases the association of transcriptional activators (DLX homeodomain proteins) with key DNA enhancers but represses gene expression. In this report, mass spectrometry shows that the Evf2-DLX1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) contains the SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodelers Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1, SMARCA4) and Brahma-associated factor (BAF170, SMARCC2) in the developing mouse forebrain. Evf2 RNA colocalizes with BRG1 in nuclear clouds and increases BRG1 association with key DNA regulatory enhancers in the developing forebrain. While BRG1 directly interacts with DLX1 and Evf2 through distinct binding sites, Evf2 directly inhibits BRG1 ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities. In vitro studies show that both RNA-BRG1 binding and RNA inhibition of BRG1 ATPase/remodeling activity are promiscuous, suggesting that context is a crucial factor in RNA-dependent chromatin remodeling inhibition. Together, these experiments support a model in which RNAs convert an active enhancer to a repressed enhancer by directly inhibiting chromatin remodeling activity, and address the apparent paradox of RNA-mediated stabilization of transcriptional activators at enhancers with a repressive outcome. The importance of BRG1/RNA and BRG1/homeodomain interactions in neurodevelopmental disorders is underscored by the finding that mutations in Coffin-Siris syndrome, a human intellectual disability disorder, localize to the BRG1 RNA-binding and DLX1-binding domains.'

aS'Genome-wide mapping and characterization of Notch-regulated long noncoding RNAs in acute leukemia.\r\nNotch signaling is a key developmental pathway that is subject to frequent genetic and epigenetic perturbations in many different human tumors. Here we investigate whether long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, in addition to mRNAs, are key downstream targets of oncogenic Notch1 in human T\xc2\xa0cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). By integrating transcriptome profiles with chromatin state maps, we have uncovered many previously unreported T-ALL-specific lncRNA genes, a fraction of which are directly controlled by the Notch1/Rpbj\xce\xba activator complex. Finally we have shown that one specific Notch-regulated lncRNA, LUNAR1, is required for efficient T-ALL growth in\xc2\xa0vitro and in\xc2\xa0vivo due to its ability to enhance IGF1R mRNA expression and sustain IGF1 signaling. These results confirm that lncRNAs are important downstream targets of the Notch signaling pathway, and additionally they are key regulators of the oncogenic state in T-ALL.'
