Long non-coding RNA LINC01296 is a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most malignant cancers, is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Recent studies indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could be robust molecular prognostic biomarkers that can refine the conventional tumor-node-metastasis staging system to predict the outcomes of CRC patients. In this study, the lncRNA expression profiles were analyzed in five datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550, GSE35834, GSE50421, and GSE31737) by probe set reannotation and an lncRNA classification pipeline. Twenty-five lncRNAs were differentially expressed between CRC tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples. In these 25 lncRNAs, patients with higher expression of LINC01296, LINC00152, and FIRRE showed significantly better overall survival than those with lower expression (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that these lncRNAs might be associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that LINC01296 overexpression was an independent predictor for patients' prognosis in the test datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550) (P = 0.001) and an independent validation series (GSE39582) (P = 0.027). Our results suggest that LINC01296 could be a novel prognosis biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC.
