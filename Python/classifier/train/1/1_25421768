[Expression of long non-coding RNA associated with radiotherapy-resistance in colorectal cancer cell lines with different radiosensitivity].
OBJECTIVE: To screen long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) associated with radiosensitivity in colorectal carcinoma cell lines.METHODS: Colony formation assay was performed in colorectal cancer cell lines HT29, SW480, RKO, Lovo and HCT116 after irradiation with different radiation doses. Radiation sensitivity of these 5 cell lines was detected through survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2 value). High-throughput lncRNA chip was used to screen lncRNA genes with expression differences more than 2 folds among SW480, RKO and Lovo. Further experiment on the expression differences of lncRNAs selected was conducted by realtime PCR.RESULTS: The radiosensitivity order of these 5 cell lines from low to high (SF2 value from high to low) was HT29 (0.83 ± 0.03), SW480 (0.69 ± 0.02), RKO(0.53 ± 0.02), Lovo (0.47 ± 0.05), HCT116 (0.32 ± 0.03) (P &lt; 0.01). Five lncRNAs associated with radiation sensitivity were screened. Among them, expression levels of R05532, NR_015441, and NR_033374 were positively correlated with radiation resistance(all P &lt; 0.01), and expression levels of the other 2 lncRNAs, NR_073156 and AA745020, were not correlated with radiation resistance of colorectal cancer cells (both P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: lncRNA R05532, NR_015441 and NR_033374 may be used as the predictive marker of radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells. Higher expression of these genes shows radiation resistance.
