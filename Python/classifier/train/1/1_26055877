Study on expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and repulsive guidance molecule b in non-small cell lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: The relationships between lncRNAs and tumors have currently become one of the focuses on cancer studies. However, there are a few studies about lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at present.METHODS: Microarray analysis was designed to study the expression patterns of lncRNAs in three pairs of NSCLC tissues. The expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and repulsive guidance molecule b (RGMB) were detected in 72 paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR assay. The relations of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and RGMB expression with clinicopathological factors of NSCLC patients were explored. A549 and SPC-A-1 cells were transfected with siRNA of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and negative control. RGMB expression level was detected by qRT-PCR assay and western blot analysis.RESULTS: The results of microarray found that 571 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in NSCLC tissues (Fold change cut-off: 5.0, P &lt; 0.05), including 304 upregulated and 267 downregulated lncRNAs. The results of qRT-PCR showed that lncRNA RGMB-AS1 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P &lt; 0.05), while RGMB mRNA showed an opposite trend (P &lt; 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1and RGMB mRNA were inversely correlated (R(2) = 0.590, P &lt; 0.05). While lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and RGMB expression levels in NSCLC tissues were associated with the occurrence of differentiation status, lymph node metastases and TNM stage (P &lt; 0.05). Transfection with siRNA of lncRNA RGMB-AS1, subsequent results showed that RGMB mRNA and protein expression were upregulated (P &lt; 0.05) in A549 and SPC-A-1 cells compared to the control groups.CONCLUSION: We identified lncRNA RGMB-AS1 was upregulated and RGMB was downregulated in NSCLC patients. Both were related to differentiation status, lymph node metastases and TNM stage. Studies also indicated that lncRNA RGMB-AS1and RGMB were inversely correlated.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/7911587521528276.
