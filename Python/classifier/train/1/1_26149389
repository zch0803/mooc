PU.1-Regulated Long Noncoding RNA lnc-MC Controls Human Monocyte/Macrophage Differentiation through Interaction with MicroRNA 199a-5p.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in mammalian development, but little is known about their roles in monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Here we identified a long noncoding monocytic RNA (lnc-MC) that exhibits increased expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is transcriptionally activated by PU.1. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrate that lnc-MC promotes monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells and CD34(+) HSPCs. Mechanistic investigation reveals that lnc-MC acts as a competing endogenous RNA to sequester microRNA 199a-5p (miR-199a-5p) and alleviate repression on the expression of activin A receptor type 1B (ACVR1B), an important regulator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. We also noted a repressive effect of miR-199a-5p on lnc-MC expression and function, but PU.1-dominant downregulation of miR-199a-5p weakens the role of miR-199a-5p in the reciprocal regulation between miR-199a-5p and lnc-MC. Altogether, our work demonstrates that two PU.1-regulated noncoding RNAs, lnc-MC and miR-199a-5p, have opposing roles in monocyte/macrophage differentiation and that lnc-MC facilitates the differentiation process, enhancing the effect of PU.1, by soaking up miR-199a-5p and releasing ACVR1B expression. Thus, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism, comprising PU.1, lnc-MC, miR-199a-5p, and ACVR1B, in monocyte/macrophage differentiation.
