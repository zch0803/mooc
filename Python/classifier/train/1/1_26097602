Prognostic significance of long non-coding RNA PCAT-1 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play widespread roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. However, the functional roles of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not yet well elucidated. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of lncRNA PCAT-1 expression in HCC and evaluate its clinical significance in the development and progression of HCC.METHODS: We examined the expression of PCAT-1 in 117 HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues using quantitative real-time-PCR and analyzed its correlation with the clinical parameters.RESULTS: Our data showed that PCAT-1 expression in HCC tissues was significantly increased compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P&lt;0.05). Up-regulated expression of PCAT-1 was significantly associated with TNM stage and metastasis (P&lt;0.05), but not other clinical parameters. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high expression level of PCAT-1 resulted in a significantly poor overall survival of HCC patients. The multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that PCAT-1 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival rate of HCC patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the increased expression of PCAT-1 was associated with advanced clinical parameters and poor overall survival of HCC patients, indicating that PCAT-1 up-regulation may serve as a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in HCC patients.
