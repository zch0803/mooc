Expression and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 in human gastric cancer.
BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the occurrence and development of human cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the functional and clinical significance of lncRNAs are still poorly understood.METHODS: In this study, the expression of LncRNA HNF1A antisense RNA 1 (HNF1A-AS1) was first examined by lncRNAs microarray analysis in 6 GC tissues, and was then further verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) both in 3 GC cell lines and 161 cases of GC tissues. We also evaluated the association between HNF1A-AS1 expression and clinicopathological features of patients with GC.RESULTS: LncRNAs microarray analysis results exhibited that HNF1A-AS1 was downregulated in GCs tissues (mean fold change 2.06, p &lt; 0.05), which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. The results from qRT-PCR showed that the expression of HNF1A-AS1 was not only downregulated in three GC cell lines (AGS, BGC-823, and MKN-45) relative to that in a normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line (GES-1), but also decreased in GC tissues relative to that in paired adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (low expression, 94 of 161; low expression rate, 58.38%). Furthermore, low HNF1A-AS1 expression was associated with tumor size/diameter (p = 0.005, multivariate analysis), levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and RRM1 expression in tissue samples (p = 0.028, p = 0.009, and p = 0.006, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 may be a regulator of GC, and thus, it may have potential as a novel biomarker and treatment target for this type of cancer.
