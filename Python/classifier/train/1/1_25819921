Long intervening non-coding RNA 00320 is human brain-specific and highly expressed in the cortical white matter.
Pervasive transcription of the genome produces a diverse array of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). One particular class of ncRNAs, long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are thought to play a role in regulating gene expression and may be a major contributor to organism and tissue complexity. The human brain with its heterogeneous cellular make-up is a rich source of lincRNAs; however, the functions of the majority of lincRNAs are unknown. Recently, by completing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the human frontal cortex, we identified linc00320 as being highly expressed in the white matter compared to grey matter in multiple system atrophy (MSA) brain. Here, we further investigate the expression patterns of linc00320 and conclude that it is involved in specific brain regions rather than having involvement in the MSA disease process. We also show that the full-length linc00320 is only expressed in human brain tissue and not in other primates, suggesting that it may be involved in improved functional connectivity for higher human brain cognition.
