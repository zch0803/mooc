Long non-coding RNA Linc-ITGB1 knockdown inhibits cell migration and invasion in GBC-SD/M and GBC-SD gallbladder cancer cell lines.
Gallbladder cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with a low 5-year survival rate. Despite advances in the molecular understanding of the initiation and progression in gallbladder cancer, treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy in advanced cases did not yield promising outcomes. Therefore, it is of great importance to uncover new mechanism underlying gallbladder cancer growth and metastasis. In this study, we identified a differentially expressed long intergenic non-coding RNA, linc-ITGB1, in a pair of higher and lower metastatic gallbladder cancer cell sublines. Then, the potential role of linc-ITGB1 in gallbladder cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was explored using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference system. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of linc-ITGB1 significantly inhibited gallbladder cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were reduced by over twofold in linc-ITGB1 knockdown cells probably due to upregulation of Î²-catenin and downregulation of vimentin, slug, and TCF8. In conclusion, linc-ITGB1 potentially promoted gallbladder cancer invasion and metastasis by accelerating the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the application of RNA interference targeting linc-ITGB1 might be a potential form of gallbladder cancer treatment in advanced cases.
