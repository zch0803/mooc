Circulating lncRNAs associated with occurrence of colorectal cancer progression.
Screening for the potential biomarker of colorectal cancer (CRC) is necessary to improve the early detection. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of circulating cell-free long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as biomarkers of CRC. In this study, we applied an lncRNA microarray to screen the potential biomarker for CRC with a multi-stage validation and risk score formula detection. We discovered three lncRNA, XLOC_006844, LOC152578 and XLOC_000303, which were up-regulated in CRC comparing with the cancer-free controls with the merged area under curve (AUC) in training set and validation set of 0.919 and 0.975. The three lncRNAs might be the potential biomarker for the tumorigenesis prediction of CRC in the future.
