Aberrant NEAT1 expression is associated with clinical outcome in high grade glioma patients.
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 has been reported to play critical roles in various human tumor entities and related to the survival of patients with malignancies. However, little is known about the role of lncRNA NEAT1 in glioma patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of NEAT1 in human glioma and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis in human glioma; we analyzed the relationship of lncRNA NEAT1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in glioma patients. In our results, the relative level of NEAT1 expression was higher in cancer tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (p &lt; 0.001). High NEAT1 expression was observed to be closely correlated with larger tumor size (p = 0.023), higher WHO grade (p = 0.005), and recurrence (p = 0.011). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high NEAT1 expression showed unfavorable overall survival (OS) than the low NEAT1 expression group (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis results revealed that NEAT1 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for OS in addition to postoperative chemoradiotherapy and WHO grade. Moreover, high NEAT1 expression in patients with stage III~IV disease and postoperative chemoradiotherapy conferred unfavorable OS (stage III~IV p = 0.002, postoperative chemoradiotherapy p = 0.000). This study supports NEAT1 as a potential prognostic predictor with its high expression in cancer tissues and its association with carcinogenesis and progression in glioma.
