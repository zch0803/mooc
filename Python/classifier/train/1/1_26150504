Long noncoding RNA derived from CD244 signaling epigenetically controls CD8+ T-cell immune responses in tuberculosis infection.
Molecular mechanisms for T-cell immune responses modulated by T cell-inhibitory molecules during tuberculosis (TB) infection remain unclear. Here, we show that active human TB infection up-regulates CD244 and CD244 signaling-associated molecules in CD8(+) T cells and that blockade of CD244 signaling enhances production of IFN-γ and TNF-α. CD244 expression/signaling in TB correlates with high levels of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-BC050410 [named as lncRNA-AS-GSTT1(1-72) or lncRNA-CD244] in the CD244(+)CD8(+) T-cell subpopulation. CD244 signaling drives lncRNA-CD244 expression via sustaining a permissive chromatin state in the lncRNA-CD244 locus. By recruiting polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to infg/tnfa promoters, lncRNA-CD244 mediates H3K27 trimethylation at infg/tnfa loci toward repressive chromatin states and inhibits IFN-γ/TNF-α expression in CD8(+) T cells. Such inhibition can be reversed by knock down of lncRNA-CD244. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of lncRNA-CD244-depressed CD8(+) T cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-infected mice reduced MTB infection and TB pathology compared with lncRNA-CD244-expressed controls. Thus, this work uncovers previously unidentified mechanisms in which T cell-inhibitory signaling and lncRNAs regulate T-cell responses and host defense against TB infection.
