Biological significance of long non-coding RNA FTX expression in human colorectal cancer.
The purpose of this study was to determine the expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FTX and analyze its prognostic and biological significance in colorectal cancer (CRC). A quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to detect the expression of long non-coding RNA FTX in 35 pairs of colorectal cancer and corresponding noncancerous tissues. The expression of long non-coding RNA FTX was detected in 187 colorectal cancer tissues and its correlations with clinicopathological factors of patients were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the prognostic significance of Long Non-coding RNA FTX expression. The effects of long non-coding RNA FTX expression on malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cells and its possible biological significances were further determined. Long non-coding RNA FTX was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, and low long non-coding RNA FTX expression was significantly correlated with differentiation grade, lymph vascular invasion, and clinical stage. Patients with high long non-coding RNA FTX showed poorer overall survival than those with low long non-coding RNA FTX. Multivariate analyses indicated that status of long non-coding RNA FTX was an independent prognostic factor for patients. Functional analyses showed that upregulation of long non-coding RNA FTX significantly promoted growth, migration, invasion, and increased colony formation in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, long non-coding RNA FTX may be a potential biomarker for predicting the survival of colorectal cancer patients and might be a molecular target for treatment of human colorectal cancer.
