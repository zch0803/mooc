A novel lncRNA, LUADT1, promotes lung adenocarcinoma proliferation via the epigenetic suppression of p27.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate the development and progression of various cancers. However, few lncRNAs have been well characterized in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Here, we identified the expression profile of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes via microarrays analysis of paired LUAD tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from five female non-smokes with LUAD. A total of 498 lncRNAs and 1691 protein-coding genes were differentially expressed between LUAD tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues. A novel lncRNA, LUAD transcript 1 (LUADT1), which is highly expressed in LUAD and correlates with T stage, was characterized. Both in vitro and in vivo data showed that LUADT1 knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation of LUAD cells and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase. Further analysis indicated that LUADT1 may regulate cell cycle progression by epigenetically inhibiting the expression of p27. RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that LUADT1 binds to SUZ12, a core component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and mediates the trimethylation of H3K27 at the promoter region of p27. The negative correlation between LUADT1 and p27 expression was confirmed in LUAD tissue samples. These data suggested that a set of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes were differentially expressed in LUAD. LUADT1 is an oncogenic lncRNA that regulates LUAD progression, suggesting that dysregulated lncRNAs may serve as key regulatory factors in LUAD progression.
