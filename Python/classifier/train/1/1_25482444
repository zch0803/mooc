Long noncoding RNAs expression signatures in chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been established to participate in various biological processes that are crucial for development and differentiation. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the mechanisms of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiation are not completely understood. The purpose of the study was to investigate the expression profiles of lncRNAs during the chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs, with a view to studying the biological function of lncRNAs and their involvement in the mechanism of differentiation. We compared the lncRNAs expression profiles of undifferentiated and differentiated cells during chondrogenic differentiation by microarray. 3638 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified (fold-change &gt;2.0 or &lt;-2.0, P&lt;0.05), consisting of 2166 up-regulated and 1472 down-regulated. Microarray data were validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analyses were applied for further study of these differentially expressed lncRNAs. Among these lncRNAs, ZBED3-AS1 and CTA-941F9.9 were further analyzed with co-expression network and target prediction analysis. The results showed that the two up-regulated lncRNAs are likely to play important roles in chondrogenic differentiation process. In conclusion, the expression profile of lncRNAs was significantly altered during differentiation process. It provided a new insight on complicated regulation mechanisms of human bone marrow MSCs chondrogenic differentiation.
