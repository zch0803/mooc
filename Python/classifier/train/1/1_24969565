lncRNA-AC130710 targeting by miR-129-5p is upregulated in gastric cancer and associates with poor prognosis.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cancer occurrence and development. However, there is largely unknown about lncRNAs significance in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. In our study, we focused on AC130710, one of lncRNAs. Gastric cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were gathered from 78 patients with gastric cancer. The AC130710 levels were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then, we further analyzed the association between AC130710 level and the clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer. Finally, the molecular mechanism underling AC130710 highly expressed in gastric cancer cells was explored. The results showed that AC130710 in cancer tissues from patients with gastric cancer was significantly higher than those in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P &lt; 0.05). Its expression level was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.013), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (P = 0.030), and distal metastasis (P = 0.018). AC130710 expression in MGC-803 was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa cell line GES-1 (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, miR-129-5p may play an important role in the downregulation of AC130710 in gastric cancer cells. These results indicated that lncRNA-AC130710 may be a potential tumor marker for gastric cancer prognosis.
