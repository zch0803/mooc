Notch-1 promotes breast cancer cells proliferation by regulating LncRNA GAS5.
BACKGROUND: Notch signaling is indicated as novel therapeutic targets to prevent recurrence of breast cancer. LncRNAs were identified as downstream target of Notch pathway. However, the exact mechanisms involved in Notch signaling, lncRNAs and breast cancer remain to be explained.OBJECTIVE: This original research aimed to determine the prognostic implications of Notch-1 for breast cancer, and explain mechanisms involved in regulation of lnRNA GAS5 by Notch-1, and identify the function of this mechanism on breast cancer.METHOD: Thirty breast cancer patients were included from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (China) since January 2006 in this study. The mRNA level by RT-PCR and protein level of Notch-1 by western blot in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were evaluated and 5-year survival analysis was applied to examine the significance of Notch-1. The levels of ten reported lncRNAs were determined by RT-PCR, and subsequently linear analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between these four unique lncRNAs and protein level of Notch-1, which identified the most relevant lncRNA GAS5 with Notch-1 in breast cancer. Subsequently, Notch1-siRNA was applied to influence the expression of Notch-1 in T47D, then the level of RSA5 was measured by RT-PCR, and CCK-8 assay was applied to measure the proliferation of T47D cells.RESULTS: High level of Notch-1 provided a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Interference of Notch-1 significantly suppressed proliferation of T47D cell (P &lt; 0.05), and significantly increased the level of GAS5.CONCLUSION: Notch-1 promotes breast cancer cells proliferation by regulating LncRNA GAS5.
