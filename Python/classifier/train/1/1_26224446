Long non-coding RNA Fer-1-like protein 4 suppresses oncogenesis and exhibits prognostic value by associating with miR-106a-5p in colon cancer.
Novel long non-coding RNA Fer-1-like protein 4 (FER1L4) has been confirmed to play crucial regulatory roles in tumor progression. It exerts an impact on tumor suppression and functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. However, its clinical significance in colon cancer is completely unknown. The aim of the present study was to annotate the role of FER1L4 and its clinical value in colon cancer. The results showed the aberrant expression of FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p in colon cancer tissues. In addition, significant negative correlation between FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p expression levels was observed. Among the colon cancer cell lines, FER1L4 levels were relatively lower, with concurrent high levels of miR-106a-5p. Restoration of FER1L4 decreased the expression of miR-106a-5p, and had a significant influence on colon cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The FER1L4 expression was correlated with depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and clinical stage. Moreover, striking differences in overall survival and disease-free survival were observed for the cases with both low FER1L4 expression and high miR-106a-5p expression compared with cases with high FER1L4 expression and low miR-106a-5p expression. Circulating FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p levels were decreased and increased, respectively, in colon cancer patients after surgery. Our findings indicated that FER1L4 could exert a tumor suppressive impact on colon cancer, which at least, in part, through suppressing miR-106a-5p expression, and depletion of FER1L4, alone or combined with overexpression of miR-106a-5p, is predictive of poor prognosis in colon cancer and may play a crucial role in cancer prevention and treatment.
