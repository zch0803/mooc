LncRNA-UCA1 exerts oncogenic functions in non-small cell lung cancer by targeting miR-193a-3p.
Recently, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been identified as an oncogenic gene in multiple human tumor entitles, and dysregulation of UCA1 was tightly linked to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, whether the aberrant expression of UCA1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with malignancy, metastasis or prognosis has not been characterized. In this study, we found that UCA1 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues. Higher expression of UCA1 led to a significantly poorer survival time, and multivariate analysis revealed that UCA1 was an independent risk factor of prognosis. UCA1 overexpression enhanced, whereas UCA1 silencing impaired the proliferation and colony formation of NSCLC cells. Moreover, mechanistic investigations showed that UCA1 upregulated the expression of miR-193a-3p target gene ERBB4 through competitively 'spongeing' miR-193a-3p. Overall, we concluded that UCA1 functions as an oncogene in NSCLC, acting mechanistically by upregulating ERBB4 in part through 'spongeing' miR-193a-3p.
