Microarray profiling of bone marrow long non-coding RNA expression in Chinese pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a role in gene transcription, protein expression and epigenetic regulation; and altered expression results in cancer development. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rare in children; and thus, this study profiled lncRNA expression in bone marrow samples from pediatric AML patients. Arraystar Human LncRNA Array V3.0 was used to profile differentially expressed lncRNAs in three bone marrow samples obtained from each pediatric AML patient and normal controls. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm dysregulated lncRNA expressions in 22 AML bone marrow samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to construct the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. A total of 372 dysregulated lncRNAs (difference â‰¥10-fold) were found in pediatric AML patients compared to normal controls. Fifty-one mRNA levels were significantly upregulated, while 85 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by &gt;10-fold in pediatric AML, compared to normal controls. GO terms and KEGG pathway annotation data revealed that cell cycle pathway-related genes were significantly associated with pediatric AML. As confirmed by qRT-PCR, expression of 24 of 97 lncRNA was altered in pediatric AML compared to normal controls. In pediatric AML, ENST00000435695 was the most upregulated lncRNA, while ENST00000415964 was the most downregulated lncRNA. Data from this study revealed dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in pediatric AML versus normal controls that could form gene pathways to regulate cell cycle progression and immunoresponse. Further studies are required to determine whether these lncRNAs could serve as novel therapeutic targets and bbdiagnostic biomarkers in pediatric AML.
