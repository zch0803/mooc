Cancer Specific Long Noncoding RNAs Show Differential Expression Patterns and Competing Endogenous RNA Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by acting with microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients, including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change â‰¥ 1.5, P &lt; 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, our results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC, and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs and 17 miRNAs in HCC.
