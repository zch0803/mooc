Decreased expression of long non-coding RNA GAS5 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating vimentin.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key in carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lncRNA GAS5 in HCC tissues and to define the role of growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) in the regulation of hepatoma cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were performed to investigate the expression of GAS5 in tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues from 50 patients with HCC. Low expression of GAS5 was significantly correlated with differentiation (P&lt;0.010) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that GAS5 expression was an independent predictor for overall survival (P=0.017). Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of GAS5 significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro. Overexpression of GAS5 significantly promoted the apoptosis of hepatoma cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that GAS5 negatively regulates vimentin expression in vitro and in vivo. Notably, vimentin knockdown promoted GAS5-pcDNA3.1-inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation. In conclusion, the present study suggests an important role of GAS5 in the molecular etiology of HCC and suggests the potential application of GAS5 in HCC therapy.
