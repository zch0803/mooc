Long non-coding RNA Loc554202 induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells via the caspase cleavage cascades.
BACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has frequently been reported in cancer studies, including those of colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNAs are significantly correlated with the pathogenesis, development and metastasis of cancer. Loc554202 is a 2166-bp transcript on human chromosome 9p21.3, the expression of which is dysregulated in breast and lung cancer cells. However, its role in CRC remains under investigation.METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to assess the relative expression of Loc554202 in CRC cell lines and tissues. Gain and/or loss of function approaches were used to investigate the potential functional roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR, western-blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related factors.RESULTS: Loc554202 was significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues and CRC cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue and a normal human intestinal epithelial cell line. Low Loc554202 expression was closely associated with advanced pathologic stage and a larger tumor size. The overexpression of Loc554202 decreased the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and hindered tumorigenesis in vivo. Loc554202 regulated cell apoptosis partly through the activation of specific caspase cleavage cascades.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Loc554202 may play an important role in the progression of CRC and could be a candidate prognostic biomarker or a target for new cancer therapies.
