Low expression of long noncoding XLOC_010588 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes proliferation through upregulation of c-Myc in cervical cancer.
OBJECTIVE: The identification and investigation of cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs are important for understanding the molecular biology of cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression pattern of lncRNA XLOC_010588 in cervical cancer and to evaluate its biological role and clinical significance in tumor progression.METHODS: We examined the expression of XLOC_010588 in 218 cervical cancer tissues and matched 218 adjacent normal tissues using real-time qRT-PCR. Over-expression and RNA interference approaches were used to investigate the biological functions of XLOC_010588. The effect of XLOC_010588 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and BrdU assays. Western blot assays were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which XLOC_010588 increases cervical cancer cell proliferation.RESULTS: The results showed that XLOC_010588 expression in cervical cancer was significantly downregulated. Decreased XLOC_010588 expression was correlated with FIGO stage, tumor size and SCC-Ag. Moreover, cervical cancer patients with XLOC_010588 lower expression have shown poorer prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that XLOC_010588 expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival. Ectopic expression of XLOC_010588 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SiHa cells. By contrast, knockdown of XLOC_010588 promoted the growth of HCC94 cells. Western blot assays confirmed that XLOC_010588 physically associates with c-Myc, consequently decreasing the expression of c-Myc. The expression of XLOC_010588 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in cervical cancer tissues.CONCLUSION: These results suggested that XLOC_010588 plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer cell proliferation via decreasing c-Myc expression and implicated the potential application of XLOC_010588 in cervical cancer therapy.
