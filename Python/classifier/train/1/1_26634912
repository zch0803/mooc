The Long Noncoding RNA IFNG-AS1 Promotes T Helper Type 1 Cells Response in Patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.
The long noncoding (lnc) RNA-Ifng-AS1 plays an essential role in the transcription of the gene encoding IFN-Î³ by Th1 cells, and its human ortholog, IFNG-AS1, is expressed in human Th1 cells. However, IFNG-AS1 contributing to Th1 cells' response in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients has not been reported. Twenty-eight HT patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The proportion of circulating Th1 cells and the level of T-bet, IFNG mRNA were increased in HT patients, the expression of IFNG-AS1 was upregulated and positively correlated with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells or T-bet, and IFNG expression, or serum level of anti-thyroglobulin antibody/thyroperoxidase antibody in HT patients. IFNG-AS1 regulated the expression of IFNG at both transcriptional and translational level in human CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, strong positive correlations between the increased transcript level of IFNG-AS1 and the increased transcript level of T-bet or IFNG were revealed in thyroid tissues from HT patients. Our results indicate that enhanced expression of lncRNA-IFNG-AS1 contributes to Th1 cell response in HT patients and may be involved in the pathogenesis of HT.
