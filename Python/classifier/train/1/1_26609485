The long non-coding RNA lnc-ZNF180-2 is a prognostic biomarker in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the most common human malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) regulate various cellular functions and have been implicated in ccRCC pathogenesis. In order to decipher the molecular biology of this tumor and to identify potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, we re-evaluated published lncRNA expression profiling data. An expression profile of 49 lncRNAs allowed discrimination of localized and advanced ccRCC. The expression profile of six lncRNAs transcripts (lnc-ACO1625, lnc-CYP4A22-2/3, lnc-PEAK1.1-1, lnc-PCYOX1L, lnc-VCAN-1, lnc-ZNF180-2) with potential prognostic interest were validated in a cohort of 50 normal renal, 57 localized ccRCC and 45 advanced ccRCC tissues. lnc-ZNF180-2 levels were similar in localized ccRCC and normal renal tissue, but we observed a significant increase of lnc-ZNF180-2 expression in advanced ccRCC tissue. Furthermore, lnc-ZNF180-2 expression levels were an independent predictor of progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival in ccRCC patients. We also observed that lnc-CYP4A22-2/3 expression levels allowed discrimination of ccRCC and normal renal tissue. In conclusion, lncRNAs are involved in renal carcinogenesis, and quantification of lnc-ZNF180-2 may be useful for the prediction of ccRCC patients outcome following nephrectomy.
