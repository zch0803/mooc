Long noncoding RNA MRUL promotes ABCB1 expression in multidrug-resistant gastric cancer cell sublines.
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the most common cause of chemotherapy failure in gastric cancer (GC) treatment; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be involved in carcinogenesis, but the effects of lncRNAs on MDR are poorly understood. We show here that the lncRNA MRUL (MDR-related and upregulated lncRNA), located 400 kb downstream of ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1), was significantly upregulated in two multidrug-resistant GC cell sublines, SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of MRUL in GC tissues were negatively correlated with in vitro growth inhibition rates of GC specimens treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and indicated a poor prognosis for GC patients. MRUL knockdown in SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR cells led to increased rates of apoptosis, increased accumulation, and reduced doxorubicin (Adriamycin [ADR]) release in the presence of ADR or vincristine. Moreover, MRUL depletion reduced ABCB1 mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Heterologous luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that MRUL might positively affect ABCB1 expression in an orientation- and position-independent manner. Our findings indicate that MRUL promotes ABCB1 expression and is a potential target to reverse the MDR phenotype of GC MDR cell sublines.
