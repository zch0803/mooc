Long noncoding RNA CCAT2 promotes breast tumor growth by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.
In addition to protein-coding genes, the human genome makes a large amount of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs could have a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis as well as cancer progression and metastasis. The lncRNA CCAT2 is dysregulated in several cancers such as colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and breast cancer; however, the contributions of CCAT2 to breast cancer remain largely unknown. In the current paper, we first confirmed the high expression level of CCAT2 in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, and we further analyzed the relationship between CCAT2 expression and clinical prognostic factors. Also, the biological function of CCAT2 was explored and the results showed silencing of CCAT2 could suppress cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Finally, our results revealed that the abnormal expression of CCAT2 could influence the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, lncRNA CCAT2 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in breast cancer development, which provides a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.
