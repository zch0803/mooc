Long non-coding RNA UCA1 contributes to the progression of prostate cancer and regulates proliferation through KLF4-KRT6/13 signaling pathway.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) UCA1 have been shown to paly an important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and UCA1 dysfunction is related to TNM stage, metastasis and postoperative survival in several cancers. However, the biological role and clinical significance of UCA1 in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) remain largely unclear. Herein, we found that UCA1 was abnormally upregulated in tumor tissues from PC patients, and patients with high UCA1 levels had a significantly poorer prognosis. Intriguingly, the mRNA and protein levels of KLF4 were significantly increased in tumor tissues, which was highly correlated to UCA1 levels. Moreover, UCA1 depletion inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. In addition, UCA1 loss-of-function could decrease KLF4 expression, subsequently, the downregulation of KRT6 and KRT13. Taken together, our study indicated that UCA1 had a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of PC. Moreover, UCA1 loss-of-function inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, at least partially, through inactivation KLF4-KRT6/13 cascade.
