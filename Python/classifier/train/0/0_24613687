Long non-coding RNA NR_045623 and NR_028291 involved in benzene hematotoxicity in occupationally benzene-exposed workers.
Benzene is an established human hematotoxicant and leukemogen. New insights into the pathogenesis of benzene hematotoxicity are urgently needed. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) widely participate in various physiological and pathological processes. It has been shown that lncRNA plays an important role in hematologic malignancy tumorigenesis. However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA during benzene hematotoxicity progress remain largely unknown. An integrated analysis of differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA was performed to identify genes which were likely to be critical for benzene hematotoxicity through Microarray analysis. Dynamic gene network analysis of the differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA was constructed and two main lncRNA (NR_045623 and NR_028291) were discovered and two key lncRNA subnets were involved in immune responses, hematopoiesis, B cell receptor signaling pathway and chronic myeloid leukemia. These findings suggested that NR_045623 and NR_028291 might be the key genes associated with benzene hematotoxicity.
