Multidrug-Resistance Related Long Non-Coding RNA Expression Profile Analysis of Gastric Cancer.
The effect of chemotherapy of gastric cancer (GC) remains very poor because of multidrug resistance (MDR). However, the mechanisms underlying MDR of GC remains far from fully understood. The aim of this study is to illustrate the potential mechanisms of the MDR of GC at mainly the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) level. In this study, GC cell line, SGC7901, and two MDR sublines, SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR were subjected to an lncRNA microarray analysis. Bioinformatics and verification experiments were performed to investigate the potential lncRNAs involved in the development of MDR. Pathway analysis indicated that 15 pathways corresponded to down-regulated transcripts and that 20 pathways corresponded to up-regulated transcripts (p-value cut-off is 0.05). GO analysis showed that the highest enriched GOs targeted by up-regulated transcripts were "system development" and the highest esenriched GOs targeted by the down-regulated transcripts were "sterol biosynthetic process". Our study is the first to interrogate differentially expressed lncRNAs in human GC cell line and MDR sublines and indicates that lncRNAs are worthwhile for further study to be the novel candidate biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of MDR and potential targets for further therapy.
