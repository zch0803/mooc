LUCA-15-encoded sequence variants regulate CD95-mediated apoptosis.
Using an expression cloning system to discover novel genes involved in apoptosis, we identified a 326 bp bone marrow cDNA fragment (termed Je2) that suppresses, upon transfection, CD95-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Sequence homology revealed that Je2 maps to 3p21.3, to an intronic region of the candidate TSG LUCA-15 locus. It represents, in fact, an antisense transcript to the 3'-UTR of two novel splice variants of this gene. Overexpression of sequence representing one of these splice variants (a 2.6 kb cDNA termed Clone 26), inhibited proliferation of Jurkat cells and sensitized them to CD95-mediated apoptosis. This study therefore implicates the LUCA-15 gene locus in the control of apoptosis.
