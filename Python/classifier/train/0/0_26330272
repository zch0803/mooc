LncRNA NALT interaction with NOTCH1 promoted cell proliferation in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) was referred to be participating in various malignant tumors. Location based analysis of the mechanism in lncRNA and genes have been highly focused. In this study, we reported that lncRNA named NALT which was located near NOTCH1 within 100 bp away. We confirmed that up-regulation of NALT associating with NOTCH1 in human samples. Increased expression of NALT dramatically promoted cell proliferation in cell lines via CCK8 assay and EDU stain. Further xenograft tumor also indicated the growth inducing affection of NALT while could be partial reversed by GSI. Besides, through sorting the side-population cells in T ALL cells treated with NALT shRNA could decrease percentage of SP cell which companied by the down-regulation of NOTCH1. Gal4-λN/BoxB reporter system revealed that the nuclear located NALT could function as a transcription activator which caused an activation of NOTCH signal pathway as confirmed by western blot. Taken together, we found a neighbor of NOTCH1, Lnc-RP11-611D20.2 (named NALT) which could regulate the NOTCH1 signal pathway through cis-regulation. This founding may trigger a comparable development of diagnosis or novel molecularly-directed therapies.
