LncRNA MIAT: Myocardial infarction associated and more.
Non-coding RNAs are emerging as regulatory RNAs that participate in the regulation of gene expression and play vital roles in various biological and pathological processes. Long non-coding (lncRNA) is a novel class of non-coding RNAs that regulates gene expression by binding to chromatin regulators and interfering RNAs to affect cellular response. Myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) is identified as lncRNAs, which is involved in various diseases, pathological and physiological processes, such as myocardial infarction, diabetic retinopathy, paranoid schizophrenia, microvascular dysfunction and formation of nuclear bodies, and neurogenic commitment. Here we review the growing understanding and potential utilization of MIAT.
