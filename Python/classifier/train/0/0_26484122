Genome-wide profiling to analyze the effects of Ox-LDL induced THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells on gene expression.
Atherosclerosis has a high incidence and is harmful to human health. An elevated level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. During atherogenesis progression, circulating monocytes adhere to the intima and differentiate into macrophages. After differentiation, intimal macrophages intake Ox-LDL via scavenger receptors, thereby transforming into foam cells. Foam cell formation due to excessive accumulation of cholesterol by macrophages is a pathological hallmark of atherosclerosis. To gain a molecular understanding of the effect of Ox-LDL in atherosclerosis development, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage transformation by microarray gene expression profiling. Here we describe in details the contents and quality controls for the gene expression and related results associated with the data uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE54039).
