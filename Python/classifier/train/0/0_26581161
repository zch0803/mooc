SET1A Cooperates With CUDR to Promote Liver Cancer Growth and Hepatocyte-like Stem Cell Malignant Transformation Epigenetically.
Long noncoding RNA CUDR plays an important role during tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that SET1A cooperates with CUDR to accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis and promote malignant transformation of hepatocyte-like stem cells. Mechanistically, CUDR enhances the phosphorylation of RB1, C-myc expression, and the interplay between the SET1A and pRB1. Notably, CUDR acts as a sponge cushion that shows a link between SET1A and pRB1, producing a activated pRB1-SET1A complex. On the other hand, the pRB1-SET1A complex may carry methyls(me) to occupy the position of H3K4, resulting in specific tri-methylation of forth lysine of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Thereby, the H3K4me3 loads on the TRF2 promoter region which causes the TRF2 overexpression. Ultimately, the excessive TRF2 binds to telomere repeat DNA, prolonging the telomere length. These findings provide the first demonstration that SET1A cooperates with CUDR to play a positive potential role during hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatocyte-like stem cells' malignant transformation epigenetically.
