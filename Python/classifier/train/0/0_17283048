Beta-globin intergenic transcription and histone acetylation dependent on an enhancer.
Histone acetyltransferases are associated with the elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex, supporting the idea that histone acetylation and transcription are intertwined mechanistically in gene coding sequences. Here, we studied the establishment and function of histone acetylation and transcription in noncoding sequences by using a model locus linking the beta-globin HS2 enhancer and the embryonic epsilon-globin gene in chromatin. An intact HS2 enhancer that recruits RNA Pol II is required for intergenic transcription and histone H3 acetylation and K4 methylation between the enhancer and target gene. RNA Pol II recruitment to the target gene TATA box is not required for the intergenic transcription or intergenic histone modifications, strongly implying that they are properties conferred by the enhancer. However, Pol II recruitment at HS2, intergenic transcription, and intergenic histone modification are not sufficient for transcription or modification of the target gene: these changes require initiation at the TATA box of the gene. The results suggest that intergenic and genic transcription complexes are independent and possibly differ from one another.
