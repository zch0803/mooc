Long noncoding RNA: a new player of heart failure?
One the most important discoveries of the post-genomic era is that a large fraction of the genome transcribes a heterogeneous population of noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). ncRNAs shorter than 200 nucleotides are usually identified as short/small ncRNAs--examples include PIWI-interacting RNAs, small interfering RNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs)--whereas those longer than 200 nucleotides are classified as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). These molecules are emerging as important regulators of cellular process, such as development, differentiation, and metabolism. Not surprisingly, ncRNAs are involved also in human diseases, such as cancer and metabolic and neuronal disorders. Although the role of miRNAs is being largely investigated in cardiovascular biology, little is known about other classes of ncRNA in this field. However, recent reports have started to reveal the importance of lncRNA in heart development and suggest also an involvement in heart failure. Here, we will discuss these reports and the therapeutic potential of lncRNA for heart failure.
