MYC regulates the non-coding transcriptome.
Using RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) of ribosome-depleted RNA, we have identified 1,273 lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) in P493-6 human B-cells. Of these, 534 are either up- or downregulated in response to MYC overexpression. An increase in MYC occupancy near their TSS (transcription start sites) was observed for MYC-responsive lncRNAs suggesting these are direct MYC targets. MYC binds to the same TSS across several cell lines, but the number of TSS bound depends on cellular MYC levels and increases with higher MYC concentrations. Despite this concordance in promoter binding, a majority of expressed lncRNAs are specific for one cell line, suggesting a determinant role of additional, possibly differentiation-specific factors in the activity of MYC-bound lncRNA promoters. A significant fraction of the lncRNA transcripts lack polyadenylation. The RNA-seq data were confirmed on eight selected lncRNAs by NRO (nuclear run-on) and RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR).
