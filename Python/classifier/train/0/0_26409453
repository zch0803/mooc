Expression analysis of four long noncoding RNAs in breast cancer.
Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease which necessitates a search for markers to provide a more specific classification of this disorder. Long noncoding RNAs as the important subset of noncoding transcripts have been shown to be involved in tumorigenic processes. So, they may be used as markers for early detection of cancer and evaluation of cancer prognosis. In addition, they can be applied as therapeutic targets. In this study, we analyzed expression of four long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) namely SOX2OT, PTPRG-AS1, ANRASSF1, and ANRIL in 38 breast cancer tissues and their adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANCTs). ANRASSF1 expression was not detected in any noncancerous tissue. All lncRNAs showed significant overexpression in tumor tissues compared with ANCTs. No association was found between gene expressions and individual clinical data such as tumor stage, grade, size and hormone receptor status except for ANRASSF1 expression and Her2/neu status. In addition, ANRASSF1 and ANRIL expressions were significantly higher in triple negative samples. This study suggests a putative role for these lncRNAs in breast cancer and implies that they can be used as potential cancer biomarkers.
