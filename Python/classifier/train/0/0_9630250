Human U19 intron-encoded snoRNA is processed from a long primary transcript that possesses little potential for protein coding.
While exons were originally defined as coding regions of split eukaryotic genes, introns have long been considered as mainly noncoding "genetic junk." However, recognition that a large number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are processed from introns of pre-mRNAs demonstrated that introns may also code for functional RNAs. Moreover, recent characterization of the mammalian UHG gene that encodes eight box C/D intronic snoRNAs suggested that some genes generate functional RNA products exclusively from their intron regions. In this study, we show that the human U19 box H/ACA snoRNA, which is encoded within the second intron of the U19H gene, represents the only functional RNA product generated from the long U19H primary transcript. Splicing of the U19H transcript, instead of giving rise to a defined RNA, produces a population of diverse U19H RNA molecules. Although the first three exons of the U19H gene are preserved in each processed U19H RNA, the 3' half of the RNA is generated by a series of apparently random splicing events. Because the U19H RNA possesses limited potential for protein coding and shows a predominant nucleoplasmic localization, we suggest that the sole function of the U19H gene is to express the U19 intronic snoRNA. This suggests that, in marked contrast to our previous dogmatic view, genes generating functionally important RNAs exclusively from their intron regions are probably more frequent than has been anticipated.
