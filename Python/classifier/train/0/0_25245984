8q24 amplified segments involve novel fusion genes between NSMCE2 and long noncoding RNAs in acute myelogenous leukemia.
The pathogenetic roles of 8q24 amplified segments in leukemic cells with double minute chromosomes remain to be verified. Through comprehensive molecular analyses of 8q24 amplicons in leukemic cells from an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient and AML-derived cell line HL60 cells, we identified two novel fusion genes between NSMCE2 and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), namely, PVT1-NSMCE2 and BF104016-NSMCE2. Our study suggests that 8q24 amplicons are associated with the emergence of aberrant chimeric genes between NSMCE2 and oncogenic lncRNAs, and also implicate that the chimeric genes involving lncRNAs potentially possess as-yet-unknown oncogenic functional roles.
