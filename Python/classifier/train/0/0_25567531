Enrichment of Human Stem-Like Prostate Cells with s-SHIP Promoter Activity Uncovers a Role in Stemness for the Long Noncoding RNA H19.
Understanding normal and cancer stem cells should provide insights into the origin of prostate cancer and their mechanisms of resistance to current treatment strategies. In this study, we isolated and characterized stem-like cells present in the immortalized human prostate cell line, RWPE-1. We used a reporter system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the promoter of s-SHIP (for stem-SH2-domain-containing 5'-inositol phosphatase) whose stem cell-specific expression has been previously shown. We observed that s-SHIP-GFP-expressing RWPE-1 cells showed stem cell characteristics such as increased expression of stem cell surface markers (CD44, CD166, TROP2) and pluripotency transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2), and enhanced sphere-forming capacity and resistance to arsenite-induced cell death. Concomitant increased expression of the long noncoding RNA H19 was observed, which prompted us to investigate a putative role in stemness for this oncofetal gene. Targeted suppression of H19 with siRNA decreased Oct4 and Sox2 gene expression and colony-forming potential in RWPE-1 cells. Conversely, overexpression of H19 significantly increased gene expression of these two transcription factors and the sphere-forming capacity of RWPE-1 cells. Analysis of H19 expression in various prostate and mammary human cell lines revealed similarities with Sox2 expression, suggesting that a functional relationship may exist between H19 and Sox2. Collectively, we provide the first evidence that s-SHIP-GFP promoter reporter offers a unique marker for the enrichment of human stem-like cell populations and highlight a role in stemness for the long noncoding RNA H19.
