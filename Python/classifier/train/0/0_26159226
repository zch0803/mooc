Genome-scale long noncoding RNA expression pattern in squamous cell lung cancer.
In this study, we aimed to explore the long noncoding RNA expression pattern in squamous cell lung cancer (SQCC) on a genome-wide scale. Total RNAs were extracted from 16 lung SQCC patients' normal and matched lung cancer tissues by Trizol reagent. The expression level of genome-wide scale lncRNA and mRNA was determined by microarray. qRT-PCR was used to validate the lncRNA expression level in 47 patients. Data analyses were performed using R and Bioconductor. A total of 2,748 up and 852 down regulated probes were identified to be significantly and differentially expressed in tumor tissues. The annotation result of their co-expressed mRNAs showed that the most significantly related category of GO analysis was development and differentiation, while the most significantly related pathway was cell cycle. Subgroup analysis identified that 46 and 18 probes were specifically differentially expressed in smoking and moderately differentiated tumors, respectively. Our study indicated that clusters of lncRNAs were significantly and differentially expressed in SQCC compared with normal tissues in the same subject. They may exert a significant role in lung cancer development and could be potential targets for future treatment of SQCC.
