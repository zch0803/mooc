Expression and functions of long noncoding RNAs during human T helper cell differentiation.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate an array of biological processes in cells and organ systems. Less is known about their expression and function in lymphocyte lineages. Here we have identified &gt;2000 lncRNAs expressed in human T-cell cultures and those that display a TH lineage-specific pattern of expression and are intragenic or adjacent to TH lineage-specific genes encoding proteins with immunologic functions. One lncRNA cluster selectively expressed by the effector TH2 lineage consists of four alternatively spliced transcripts that regulate the expression of TH2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Genes encoding this lncRNA cluster in humans overlap the RAD50 gene and thus are contiguous with the previously described TH2 locus control region (LCR) in the mouse. Given its genomic synteny with the TH2-LCR, we refer to this lncRNA cluster as TH2-LCR lncRNA.
