A de novo balanced t(2;6)(p15;p22.3) in a patient with West Syndrome disrupts a lnc-RNA.
In a male patient with West Syndrome we identified a perfectly balanced, de novo balanced translocation 46,XY,t(2;6)(p15;p22.3). No known protein coding genes were disrupted by the translocation and positional effects on nearby genes were excluded by expression studies. A putative long non-coding RNA, BX118339, spans the breakpoint on chromosome 6. It can be hypothesized that disruption of this non-coding transcript plays a role in the pathogenesis of the patient.
