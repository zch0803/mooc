A nomenclature for all signal recognition particle RNAs.
The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complex that guides secretory proteins to biological membranes in all organisms. The SRP RNA is at the center of the structure and function of the SRP. The comparison of the growing number of SRP RNA sequences provides a rich source for gaining valuable insight into the composition, assembly, and phylogeny of the SRP. In order to assist in the continuation of these studies, we propose an SRP RNA nomenclature applicable to the three divisions of life.
