UM 9(5)h and UM 9(5)p, human and porcine noncoding transcripts with preferential expression in the cerebellum.
We compared the gene expression patterns of fetal and adult porcine brains and identified a sequence tag that was more abundant in adult than in fetal brain. The RNA corresponding to the sequence tag has the highest expression level in adult cerebellum. Lower expression levels of the transcript were found in adult cerebrum, pituitary, and uterus, as well as in fetal brain, heart, intestine, kidney, and liver. The sequence tag was used to screen a cDNA library from adult porcine brain. Two independent clones of 2,273 nt and 1,701 nt were isolated. The shorter cDNA is a 5'-truncated form of the longer clone, and both clones have almost identical sequences with multiple start and stop codons in all three reading frames. Screening of two different human brain cDNA libraries with porcine cDNA probes resulted in four overlapping cDNA fragments, which were assembled to one contig of 2,336 nt in length. Like noncoding RNAs, the porcine and human sequences have no common conserved open reading frame and share stretches of high homology interrupted by stretches with almost no homology. The human and porcine RNAs were named UM 9(5)h and UM 9(5)p, respectively. They are part of larger transcripts, which are transcribed from single-copy genes, they have very similar tissue distributions, and their sequences are colinear with the respective genomic fragment.
