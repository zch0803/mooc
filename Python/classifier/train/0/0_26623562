The role of the oncofetal H19 lncRNA in tumor metastasis: orchestrating the EMT-MET decision.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are emerging as key players in the metastatic cascade. Current evidence indicate that H19 lncRNA and the microRNA(miRNA) miR-675, which is processed from it, play crucial roles in metastasis, through the regulation of critical events specifically the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and the mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET). This review summarizes recent mechanistic pathways and tries to put together seemingly conflicting data from different reports under one proposed general scheme underlying the various roles of H19/miR-675 in the metastatic cascade. We propose several approaches to harnessing this knowledge for translational medicine.
