S'Circulating lncRNAs associated with occurrence of colorectal cancer progression.\r\nScreening for the potential biomarker of colorectal cancer (CRC) is necessary to improve the early detection. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of circulating cell-free long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as biomarkers of CRC. In this study, we applied an lncRNA microarray to screen the potential biomarker for CRC with a multi-stage validation and risk score formula detection. We discovered three lncRNA, XLOC_006844, LOC152578 and XLOC_000303, which were up-regulated in CRC comparing with the cancer-free controls with the merged area under curve (AUC) in training set and validation set of 0.919 and 0.975. The three lncRNAs might be the potential biomarker for the tumorigenesis prediction of CRC in the future.'

aS'Decreased expression of long noncoding RNA AC096655.1-002 in gastric cancer and its clinical significance.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newfound noncoding RNAs that are greater than 200 nucleotides in length. They have emerged recently as major players in governing fundamental biological processes. However, the expression level of lncRNAs and their clinical significances are not well understood. To investigate the lncRNA expression in gastric cancer, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was conducted. Then, the association between the level of AC096655.1-002, one of lncRNA, in gastric cancer tissues and the clinicopathological features of patients with gastric cancer was further analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic values. The results showed that AC096655.1-002 was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent non-tumorous tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Its expression level was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001), distant metastasis (P &lt; 0.001), tumor-node-metastasis stages (P &lt; 0.001), and differentiation (P = 0.030). The area under the ROC curve of AC096655.1-002 was up to 0.731. For the detection of gastric cancer, the use of AC096655.1-002 showed a remarkable improvement compared with the use of serum carcinoembryonic antigen. These results indicated that lncRNA AC096655.1-002 may be a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma.'

aS'lncRNA-MIAT regulates microvascular dysfunction by functioning as a competing endogenous RNA.\r\nRATIONALE: Pathological angiogenesis is a critical component of diseases, such as ocular disorders, cancers, and atherosclerosis. It is usually caused by the abnormal activity of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell motility, immune, or inflammation response. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of these biological processes. However, the role of lncRNA in diabetes mellitus-induced microvascular dysfunction is largely unknown.OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whether lncRNA-myocardial infarction-associated transcript (MIAT) is involved in diabetes mellitus-induced microvascular dysfunction.METHODS AND RESULTS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated increased expression of lncRNA-MIAT in diabetic retinas and endothelial cells cultured in high glucose medium. Visual electrophysiology examination, TUNEL staining, retinal trypsin digestion, vascular permeability assay, and in vitro studies revealed that MIAT knockdown obviously ameliorated diabetes mellitus-induced retinal microvascular dysfunction in vivo, and inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and in vitro studies revealed that MIAT functioned as a competing endogenous RNA, and formed a feedback loop with vascular endothelial growth factor and miR-150-5p to regulate endothelial cell function.CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the involvement of lncRNA-MIAT in pathological angiogenesis and facilitates the development of lncRNA-directed diagnostics and therapeutics against neovascular diseases.'

aS'ANRIL regulates the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells in both two- and three-dimensional culture.\r\nANRIL is a long noncoding RNA transcribed from the INK4 locus that encodes three tumor suppressor genes, p15, p16, and ARF. Previous studies demonstrated that ANRIL represses p15 and p16, which positively regulate the pRB pathway, leading to repression of cellular senescence of human normal fibroblasts. However, the role of ANRIL in cancer cell proliferation is less well understood. Here we report that ANRIL is involved in the proliferation of colorectal cancer HCT116 cells in two- and three-dimensional culture. Silencing ANRIL by both transfection with small interfering RNA and retrovirally produced small hairpin RNA reduced HCT116 cell proliferation in both two- and three-dimensional culture. HCT116 cells depleted for ANRIL were arrested in the S phase of cell cycle. Notably, silencing ANRIL did not result in the activation of expression of the INK4 locus. These results suggest that ANRIL positively regulates the proliferation of HCT116 cells in two- and three-dimensional culture in a p15/p16-pRB pathway-independent manner.'

aS'The Malat1 long non-coding RNA is upregulated by signalling through the PERK axis of unfolded protein response during flavivirus infection.\r\nFlavivirus infection causes host cell death by initiation of an unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is initiated following activation of three ER-membrane resident sensors, PERK, IRE1\xce\xb1 and ATF6, which are otherwise kept inactive through association with the ER-chaperone GRP78. Activation precedes cellular and molecular changes that act to restore homeostasis but might eventually initiate apoptosis. These changes involve influencing function of multiple genes by either transcriptional or post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Transcriptional control includes expression of transcription factor cascades, which influence cognate gene expression. Malat1 is a long non-coding RNA which is over-expressed in many human oncogenic tissues and regulates cell cycle and survival. In this report, for the first time we show activation of Malat1 following infection by two flaviviruses, both of which activate the UPR in host cells. The temporal kinetics of expression was restricted to later time points. Further, Malat1 was also activated by pharmacological inducer of UPR, to a similar degree. Using drugs that specifically inhibit or activate the PERK or IRE1\xce\xb1 sensors, we demonstrate that signalling through the PERK axis activates this expression, through a transcriptional mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an UPR pathway regulating the expression of an lncRNA.'

aS'Altered expression of long non-coding RNAs during genotoxic stress-induced cell death in human glioma cells.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a recently discovered class of non-coding genes, are transcribed throughout the genome. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs may be involved in modulating various aspects of tumor biology, including regulating gene activity in response to external stimuli or DNA damage. No data are available regarding the expression of lncRNAs during genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and/or necrosis in human glioma cells. In this study, we detected a change in the expression of specific candidate lncRNAs (neat1, GAS5, TUG1, BC200, Malat1, MEG3, MIR155HG, PAR5, and ST7OT1) during DNA damage-induced apoptosis in human glioma cell lines (U251 and U87) using doxorubicin (DOX) and resveratrol (RES). We also detected the expression pattern of these lncRNAs in human glioma cell lines under necrosis induced using an increased dose of DOX. Our results reveal that the lncRNA expression patterns are distinct between genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis and necrosis in human glioma cells. The sets of lncRNA expressed during genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis were DNA-damaging agent-specific. Generally, MEG3 and ST7OT1 are up-regulated in both cell lines under apoptosis induced using both agents. The induction of GAS5 is only clearly detected during DOX-induced apoptosis, whereas the up-regulation of neat1 and MIR155HG is only found during RES-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. However, TUG1, BC200 and MIR155HG are down regulated when necrosis is induced using a high dose of DOX in both cell lines. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the distinct regulation of lncRNAs may possibly involve in the process of cellular defense against genotoxic agents.'

aS"Long non-coding RNA HULC promotes tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer by up-regulating sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1).\r\nHighly up-regulated in liver cancer (HULC) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). We found that HULC up-regulated sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), which is involved in tumor angiogenesis. Levels of HULC were positively correlated with levels of SPHK1 and its product, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in patients HCC samples. HULC increased SPHK1 in hepatoma cells. Chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays revealed that si-SPHK1 remarkably blocked the HULC-enhanced angiogenesis. Mechanistically, HULC activated the promoter of SPHK1 in hepatoma cells through the transcription factor E2F1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) further showed that E2F1 was capable of binding to the E2F1 element in the SPHK1 promoter. HULC increased the expression of E2F1 in hepatoma cells and levels of HULC were positively correlated with those of E2F1 in HCC tissues. Intriguingly, HULC sequestered miR-107, which targeted E2F1 mRNA 3'UTR, by complementary base pairing. Functionally, si-SPHK1 remarkably abolished the HULC-enhanced tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we conclude that HULC promotes tumor angiogenesis in liver cancer through miR-107/E2F1/SPHK1 signaling. Our finding provides new insights into the mechanism of tumor angiogenesis."

aS'Colon Cancer Associated Transcript-1 (CCAT1) Expression in Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have functional roles in cancer biology and are dys-regulated in many tumors. Colon Cancer Associated Transcript -1 (CCAT1) is a lncRNA, previously shown to be significantly up-regulated in colon cancer. The aim of this study is to determine expression levels of CCAT1 in gastric carcinoma (GC).METHODS: Tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing resection for gastric carcinoma (n=19). For each patient, tumor tissue and normal appearing gastric mucosa were taken. Normal gastric tissues obtained from morbidly obese patients, undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy served as normal controls (n=19). A human gastric carcinoma cell line (AGS) served as positive control. RNA was extracted from all tissue samples and CCAT1 expression was analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR).RESULTS: Low expression of CCAT1 was identified in normal gastric mucosa samples obtained from morbidly obese patients [mean Relative Quantity (RQ) = 1.95\xc2\xb10.4]. AGS human gastric carcinoma cell line showed an elevated level of CCAT1 expression (RQ=8.02). Expression levels of CCAT1 were approximately 10.8 fold higher in GC samples than in samples taken from the negative control group (RQ=21.1\xc2\xb15 vs. RQ=1.95\xc2\xb10.4, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, CCAT1 expression was significantly overexpressed in adjacent normal tissues when compared to the negative control group (RQ = 15.25\xc2\xb12 vs. RQ=1.95\xc2\xb10.4, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Tissues obtained from recurrent GC cases showed the highest expression levels (RQ = 88.8\xc2\xb131; p&lt;0.001). Expression levels increased with tumor stage (T4- 36.4\xc2\xb115, T3- 16.1\xc2\xb16, T2- 4.7\xc2\xb11), however this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.2). There was no difference in CCAT1 expression between intestinal and diffuse type GC (RQ=22.4\xc2\xb17 vs. 22.4\xc2\xb116, respectively, p=0.9). Within the normal gastric tissue samples, no significant difference in CCAT1 expression was observed in helicobacter pylori negative and positive patients (RQ= 2.4\xc2\xb10.9 vs. 0.93\xc2\xb10.2, respectively, p=0.13).CONCLUSION: CCAT1 is up-regulated in gastric cancer, and may serve as a potential bio-marker for early detection and surveillance.'

aS'Small nucleolar RNA host genes and long non-coding RNA responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells.\r\nThe irradiated cells communicate with unirradiated cells and induce changes in them through a phenomenon known as the bystander effect. The nature of the bystander signal and how it impacts unirradiated cells remains to be discovered. Examination of molecular changes could lead to the identification of pathways underlying the bystander effect. Apart from microRNAs, little is known about the regulation of other non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) in irradiated or bystander cells. In this study we monitored the transcriptional changes of several small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) host genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are known to participate in a variety of cellular functions, in irradiated and bystander cells to gain insight into the molecular pathways affected in these cells. We used human lymphoblasts TK6 cells in a medium exchanged bystander effect model system to examine ncRNA expression alterations. The snoRNA host genes SNHG1 and SNHG4 were upregulated in irradiated TK6 cells but were repressed in bystander cells. The SNHG5 and SNHG11 were downregulated in irradiated and bystander cells and the expression levels of these ncRNA were significantly lower in bystander cells. The lncRNA MALAT1, MATR3, SRA1, and SOX2OT were induced in irradiated TK6 cells and their expression levels were repressed in bystander cells. The lncRNA RMST was induced in both irradiated and bystander cells. Taken together, these results indicate that expression levels of ncRNA are modulated in irradiated and bystander cells and these transcriptional changes could be associated with the bystander effect.'

aS'Linc00963: a novel, long non-coding RNA involved in the transition of prostate cancer from androgen-dependence to androgen-independence.\r\nWhole genome transcriptomic analyses have identified a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), many of which are involved in a variety of biological functions. However, their functions and molecular mechanisms associated with prostate cancer (PCa) progression to a virulent and androgen-independent (AI) form remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the lncRNA expression profiles of the indolent, androgen-dependent (AD) LNCaP cell line to the aggressive metastatic, AI C4-2 cell line using microarray technology. The differentially expressed lncRNAs and genes were identified by microarray technology and the association in cis or in trans was analyzed to find potential lncRNA target genes. Expression of candidate lncRNAs and putative targets was evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The functions of linc00963 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were evaluated by a knockdown strategy in vitro using MTT, flow cytometric analysis and transwell chamber assays. lncRNAs (n=134) were differentially expressed (FDR&lt;0.001 and fold change\xe2\x89\xa52) between the LNCaP and C4-2 cell lines. Linc00963 was upregulated most obviously evaluated by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of linc00963 attenuated C4-2 cell proliferation, motility, invasion ability, the expression of EGFR and phosphorylation levels of AKT, and promoted cell apoptosis. Linc00963 was involved in the prostate cancer transition from androgen-dependent to androgen-independent and metastasis via the EGFR signaling pathway.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA TARID directs demethylation and activation of the tumor suppressor TCF21 via GADD45A.\r\nDNA methylation is a dynamic and reversible process that governs gene expression during development and disease. Several examples of active DNA demethylation have been documented, involving genome-wide and gene-specific DNA demethylation. How demethylating enzymes are targeted to specific genomic loci remains largely unknown. We show that an antisense lncRNA, termed TARID (for TCF21 antisense RNA inducing demethylation), activates TCF21 expression by inducing promoter demethylation. TARID interacts with both the TCF21 promoter and GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha), a regulator of DNA demethylation. GADD45A in turn recruits thymine-DNA glycosylase for base excision repair-mediated demethylation involving oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the TCF21 promoter by ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase proteins. The results reveal a function of lncRNAs, serving as a genomic address label for GADD45A-mediated demethylation of specific target genes.'

aS'HBx-related long non-coding RNA DBH-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating MAPK signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nAccumulating evidence supports an important role for the hepatitis B virus x protein (HBx) in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Here, we identified a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DBH-AS1 involved in the HBx-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. The levels of DBH-AS1 were positively correlated with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and tumor size in HCC tissues. Functionally, transgenic expression of DBH-AS1 significantly enhanced cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas short hairpin RNA knockdown of DBH-AS1 caused an inhibition of cell proliferation. Mechanistically, overexpression of DBH-AS1 induced cell cycle progression by accelerating G1/S and G2/M transition concomitantly with upregulation of CDK6, CCND1, CCNE1 and downregulation of p16, p21 and p27. We also found that enhanced DBH-AS1 expression inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis of HCC cells. In contrast, suppressed DBH-AS1 expression had opposite effects. Furthermore, DBH-AS1 was shown to activate MAPK pathway. We also provide evidence that DBH-AS1 could be significantly induced by HBx protein and markedly down-regulated by p53. Thus, we concluded that DBH-AS1 can be induced by HBx and inactivated by p53, and consequently promote cell proliferation and cell survival through activation of MAPK signaling in HCC. Our study suggests that DBH-AS1 acts as an oncogene for HCC.'

aS'Characterization of a novel long noncoding RNA, SCAL1, induced by cigarette smoke and elevated in lung cancer cell lines.\r\nThe incidence of lung diseases and cancer caused by cigarette smoke is increasing. The molecular mechanisms of gene regulation induced by cigarette smoke that ultimately lead to cancer remain unclear. This report describes a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) both in vitro and in vivo and is elevated in numerous lung cancer cell lines. We have termed this lncRNA the smoke and cancer-associated lncRNA-1 (SCAL1). This lncRNA is located in chromosome 5, and initial sequencing analysis reveals a transcript with four exons and three introns. The expression of SCAL1 is regulated transcriptionally by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2), as determined by the small, interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of NRF2 and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). A nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (NF-E2) motif was identified in the promoter region that shows binding to NRF2 after its activation. Functionally, the siRNA knockdown of SCAL1 in human bronchial epithelial cells shows a significant potentiation of cytotoxicity induced by CSE in vitro. Altogether, these results identify a novel and intriguing new noncoding RNA that may act downstream of NRF2 to regulate gene expression and mediate oxidative stress protection in airway epithelial cells.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA TUG1 regulates blood-tumor barrier permeability by targeting miR-144.\r\nBlood-tumor barrier (BTB) limits the delivery of chemotherapeutic agent to brain tumor tissues. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in various biologic processes of tumors. However, the role of lncRNAs in BTB permeability is unclear. LncRNA TUG1 (taurine upregulated gene 1) was highly expressed in glioma vascular endothelial cells from glioma tissues. It also upregulated in glioma co-cultured endothelial cells (GEC) from BTB model in vitro. Knockdown of TUG1 increased BTB permeability, and meanwhile down-regulated the expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. Both bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that TUG1 influenced BTB permeability via binding to miR-144. Furthermore, Knockdown of TUG1 also down-regulated Heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2), a transcription factor of the heat shock transcription factor family, which was defined as a direct and functional downstream target of miR-144. HSF2 up-regulated the promoter activities and interacted with the promoters of ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 in GECs. In conclusion, our results indicate that knockdown of TUG1 increased BTB permeability via binding to miR-144 and then reducing EC tight junction protein expression by targeting HSF2. Thus, TUG1 may represent a useful future therapeutic target for enhancing BTB permeability.'

aS'Co\xe2\x80\x91expression of the carbamoyl\xe2\x80\x91phosphate synthase\xc2\xa01 gene\xc2\xa0and its long non\xe2\x80\x91coding RNA correlates with poor prognosis of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\r\nThe mechanisms leading to high rates of malignancy and recurrence of human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) remain unclear. It is difficult to diagnose and assess the prognosis of patients with ICC in the clinic due to the lack of specific biomarkers. In addition, long non\xe2\x80\x91coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to serve important roles in certain types of tumorigenesis however a role in ICC remains to be reported. The aim of the current study was to screen for genes and lncRNAs that are abnormally expressed in ICC and to investigate their biological and clinicopathological significance in ICC. The global gene and lncRNA expression profiles in ICC were measured using bioinformatics analysis. Carbamoyl\xe2\x80\x91phosphate synthase\xc2\xa01 (CPS1) and its lncRNA CPS1 intronic transcript\xc2\xa01 (CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1) were observed to be upregulated in ICC. The expression of CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 was measured in 31\xc2\xa0tissue samples from patients with ICC and a number of cell lines. The effects of CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 on the proliferation and apoptosis of the ICC\xe2\x80\x919810\xc2\xa0cell line were measured. In addition, the clinicopathological features and survival rates of patients with ICC with respect to the gene and lncRNA expression status were analyzed. CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 were co\xe2\x80\x91upregulated in ICC tissues compared with non\xe2\x80\x91cancerous tissues. Knockdown of CPS1 andor CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 reduced the proliferation and increased the apoptosis of ICC\xe2\x80\x919810\xc2\xa0cells. Additionally, clinical analysis indicated that CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 were associated with poor liver function and reduced survival rates when the relative expression values were greater than 4 in cancer tissues. The comparisons between the high CPS1 expression group and the low expression group indicated significant differences in international normalized ratio (P=0.048), total protein (P=0.049), indirect bilirubin (P=0.025), alkaline phosphatase (P=0.003) and disease\xe2\x80\x91free survival (P=0.034). In addition, there were differential trends in CA19\xe2\x80\x919 (P=0.068), globulin (P=0.052) and total bilirubin (P=0.066). The comparisons between the high CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 expression group and the low expression group indicated significant differences in lymphatic invasion (P=0.045), carbohydrate antigen\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x919 (P=0.044), disease\xe2\x80\x91free survival (P=0.026), and non\xe2\x80\x91significant differential trends in alkaline phosphatase were observed (P=0.085). In conclusion, CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 may serve an important role in ICC development by promoting the proliferation of ICC cells. Furthermore, CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 were associated with poor liver function and reduced survival rates. Thus, CPS1 and CPS1\xe2\x80\x91IT1 may be potential prognostic indicators for patients with ICC.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA expression profile of hepatocellular carcinoma identified by microarray analysis.\r\nBACKGROUND: Thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported in mammalian genomes. These RNAs represent an important subset of pervasive genes involved in a broad range of biological functions. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with many types of cancers. Here, in order to explore the potential lncRNAs involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) oncogenesis, we performed lncRNA gene expression profile analysis in 3 pairs of human HCC and adjacent non-tumor (NT) tissues by microarray.METHODOLOGY: Differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were detected by human lncRNA microarray containing 33,045 lncRNAs and 30,215 coding transcripts. Bioinformatic analyses (gene ontology, pathway and network analysis) were applied for further study of these differentially expressed mRNAs. By qRT-PCR analysis in nineteen pairs of HCC and adjacent normal tissues, we found that eight lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in HCC compared with adjacent NT tissues, which is consistent with microarray data.CONCLUSIONS: We identified 214 lncRNAs and 338 mRNAs abnormally expressed in all three HCC tissues (Fold Change \xe2\x89\xa52.0, P&lt;0.05 and FDR &lt;0.05) with the genome-wide lncRNAs and mRNAs expression profile analysis. The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed, which may be used for predicting target genes of lncRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that BC017743, ENST00000395084, NR_026591, NR_015378 and NR_024284 were up-regulated, whereas NR_027151, AK056988 and uc003yqb.1 were down-regulated in nineteen pairs of HCC samples compared with adjacent NT samples. Expression of seven lncRNAs was significantly correlated to their nearby coding genes. In conclusion, our results indicated that the lncRNA expression profile in HCC was significantly changed, and we identified a series of new hepatocarcinoma associated lncRNAs. These results provide important insights about the lncRNAs in HCC pathogenesis.'

aS'SP1-induced upregulation of the long noncoding RNA TINCR regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by affecting KLF2 mRNA stability in gastric cancer.\r\nThe long noncoding RNA TINCR shows aberrant expression in human squamous carcinomas. However, its expression and function in gastric cancer remain unclear. We report that TINCR is strongly upregulated in human gastric carcinoma (GC), where it was found to contribute to oncogenesis and cancer progression. We also revealed that TINCR overexpression is induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1. Silencing TINCR expression inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, tumorigenicity and apoptosis promotion, whereas TINCR overexpression promoted cell growth, as documented in the SGC7901 and BGC823 cell lines. Mechanistic analyses indicated that TINCR could bind to STAU1 (staufen1) protein, and influence KLF2 mRNA stability and expression, then KLF2 regulated cyclin-dependent kinase genes CDKN1A/P21 and CDKN2B/P15 transcription and expression, thereby affecting the proliferation and apoptosis of GC cells. Together, our findings suggest that TINCR contributes to the oncogenic potential of GC and may constitute a potential therapeutic target in this disease.'

aS'Regulation of Emx2 expression by antisense transcripts in murine cortico-cerebral precursors.\r\nBACKGROUND: Emx2 encodes for a transcription factor expressed in the embryonic intermediate mesoderm and central nervous system (CNS). It is implicated in several aspects of cerebral cortex development, including morphogenetic field specification, arealization, precursor proliferation and lamination. Four Emx2-associated antisense transcripts have been found in the urogenital system; one of them, Emx2OS, has been also detected in the adult brain. Until now, however, nothing is known about expression and function of Emx2OS in the developing CNS.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, we reconstructed the Emx2OS expression profile in the embryonic CNS, paying special attention to the developing cerebral cortex. Emx2OS was observed in a number of CNS structures expressing also Emx2. Within the cortex, Emx2OS was detectable in periventricular precursors, expressing the sense transcript, and peaked in newly born post-mitotic neurons not expressing such transcript. By integrating lentiviral gene delivery, RNAi, TetON technology, morpholino-mediated gene knock-down, drug-induced perturbation of gene expression, and quantitative RT-PCR, we addressed possible roles of Ex2 antisense RNA in Emx2 regulation, in primary CNS precursor cultures. We found that, in both cortical precursors and their neuronal progenies, Emx2 antisense RNA contributes to post-transcriptional down-regulation of its sense partner, possibly by a Dicer-promoted mechanism. The same RNA, when delivered to rhombo-spinal precursors, stimulates ectopic expression of Emx2, whereas Emx2 knock-out dramatically impairs Emx2OS transcription. This suggests that, within the developing CNS, a reciprocal Emx2/Emx2OS regulatory loop may normally sustain transcription at the Emx2 locus.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that antisense transcripts may contribute to developmental regulation of a key transcription factor gene implicated in CNS patterning, possibly by complex and multilevel mechanisms. The activation of Emx2 by a short antisense transcript may be a prototype of a method for overexpressing single specific genes, without introducing additional copies of them into the genome.'

aS'Identification of novel long non-coding RNAs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play an important role in carcinogenesis; knowledge on lncRNA expression in renal cell carcinoma is rudimental. As a basis for biomarker development, we aimed to explore the lncRNA expression profile in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissue.RESULTS: Microarray experiments were performed to determine the expression of 32,183 lncRNA transcripts belonging to 17,512 lncRNAs in 15 corresponding normal and malignant renal tissues. Validation was performed using quantitative real-time PCR in 55 ccRCC and 52 normal renal specimens. Computational analysis was performed to determine lncRNA-microRNA (MiRTarget2) and lncRNA-protein (catRAPID omics) interactions. We identified 1,308 dysregulated transcripts (expression change &gt;2-fold; upregulated: 568, downregulated: 740) in ccRCC tissue. Among these, aberrant expression was validated using PCR: lnc-BMP2-2 (mean expression change: 37-fold), lnc-CPN2-1 (13-fold), lnc-FZD1-2 (9-fold), lnc-ITPR2-3 (15-fold), lnc-SLC30A4-1 (15-fold), and lnc-SPAM1-6 (10-fold) were highly overexpressed in ccRCC, whereas lnc-ACACA-1 (135-fold), lnc-FOXG1-2 (19-fold), lnc-LCP2-2 (2-fold), lnc-RP3-368B9 (19-fold), and lnc-TTC34-3 (314-fold) were downregulated. There was no correlation between lncRNA expression with clinical-pathological parameters. Computational analyses revealed that these lncRNAs are involved in RNA-protein networks related to splicing, binding, transport, localization, and processing of RNA. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of lnc-BMP2-2 and lnc-CPN2-1 did not influence cell proliferation.CONCLUSIONS: We identified many novel lncRNA transcripts dysregulated in ccRCC which may be useful for novel diagnostic biomarkers.'

aS'Inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis by silencing long non-coding RNA PCAT-1 in human bladder cancer.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that play important roles in cancer development and progression. Prostate cancer-associated transcript 1 (PCAT-1) is a novel lncRNA that promotes cell proliferation in prostate cancer. We hypothesized that PCAT-1 also have roles in bladder cancer. In this study, we found that PCAT-1 was up-regulated in bladder cancer compared to paired normal urothelium. Cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction were also observed in PCAT-1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-transfected bladder cancer T24 and 5637 cells. Our data suggest that PCAT-1 plays oncogenic roles and can be used as a therapeutic target for treating human bladder cancer.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA, CCDC26, controls myeloid leukemia cell growth through regulation of KIT expression.\r\nBACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in certain diseases, such as cancer. The lncRNA, CCDC26, is related to childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) because its copy number is altered in AML patients.RESULTS: We found that CCDC26 transcripts were abundant in the nuclear fraction of K562 human myeloid leukemia cells. To examine the function of CCDC26, gene knockdown (KD) was performed using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and four KD clones, in which CCDC26 expression was suppressed to 1% of its normal level, were isolated. This down-regulation included suppression of CCDC26 intron-containing transcripts (the CCDC26 precursor mRNA), indicating that transcriptional gene suppression (TGS), not post-transcriptional suppression, was occurring. The shRNA targeting one of the two CCDC26 splice variants also suppressed the other splice variant, which is further evidence for TGS. Growth rates of KD clones were reduced compared with non-KD control cells in media containing normal or high serum concentrations. In contrast, enhanced growth rates in media containing much lower serum concentrations and increased survival periods after serum withdrawal were observed for KD clones. DNA microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction screening for differentially expressed genes between KD clones and non-KD control cells revealed significant up-regulation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, KIT, hyperactive mutations of which are often found in AML. Treatment of KD clones with ISCK03, a KIT-specific inhibitor, eliminated the increased survival of KD clones in the absence of serum.CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CCDC26 controls growth of myeloid leukemia cells through regulation of KIT expression. A KIT inhibitor might be an effective treatment against the forms of AML in which CCDC26 is altered.'

aS"Long non-coding RNA LINC01296 is a potential prognostic biomarker in patients with colorectal cancer.\r\nColorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most malignant cancers, is currently the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Recent studies indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could be robust molecular prognostic biomarkers that can refine the conventional tumor-node-metastasis staging system to predict the outcomes of CRC patients. In this study, the lncRNA expression profiles were analyzed in five datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550, GSE35834, GSE50421, and GSE31737) by probe set reannotation and an lncRNA classification pipeline. Twenty-five lncRNAs were differentially expressed between CRC tissue and tumor-adjacent normal tissue samples. In these 25 lncRNAs, patients with higher expression of LINC01296, LINC00152, and FIRRE showed significantly better overall survival than those with lower expression (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05), suggesting that these lncRNAs might be associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis indicated that LINC01296 overexpression was an independent predictor for patients' prognosis in the test datasets (GSE24549, GSE24550) (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.001) and an independent validation series (GSE39582) (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.027). Our results suggest that LINC01296 could be a novel prognosis biomarker for the diagnosis of CRC."

aS'Time, dose and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) status dependency of coding and noncoding RNA expression after ionizing radiation exposure.\r\nStudies of gene expression have proved important in defining the molecular mechanisms of radiation action and identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure and susceptibility. The full transcriptional response to radiation is very complex since it also involves epigenetic mechanisms triggered by radiation exposure such as modifications of expression of noncoding RNA such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have not been fully characterized. To improve our understanding of the transcriptional response to radiation, we simultaneously monitored the expression of ten protein-coding genes, as well as 19 miRNAs and 3 lncRNAs in a time- and dose-dependent manner in stimulated human T lymphocytes obtained from two healthy donors (C1 and C2) and one patient with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), which is a well characterized radiosensitivity disorder. After 2 Gy X irradiation, expression levels were monitored at time points ranging from 15 min up to 24 h postirradiation. The majority of genes investigated responded rapidly to radiation exposure, with the peak up-regulation (CDKN1A, SESN1, ATF3, MDM2, PUMA and GADD45A) or down-regulation (CCNB1) occurring 2-3 h postirradiation, while DDB2, FDXR and CCNG1 responded with slower kinetics reaching a peak of expression between 5 and 24 h. A significant modification of expression after radiation exposure was observed for miR-34a-5p and miR-182-5p, with an up-regulation occurring at late time points reaching two to threefold at 24 h. Differences between two donors in miR-182-5p response to radiation were detected: for C2, up-regulation reached a plateau-phase around 5 Gy, while for C1, up-regulation was at its maximum around 3 Gy and then decreased at higher doses. Among the three lncRNAs studied, TP53TG1 demonstrated a weak up-regulation, reaching a maximum of 1.5-fold at 24 h after radiation exposure. Conversely, FAS-AS1 was up-regulated up to fivefold by 5 Gy irradiation. Our results indicate that expression of the majority of protein-coding genes allows discrimination of the AT from healthy donors when analyzed at 2 h. However, differences in expression between AT and healthy donors are no longer detectable 24 h postirradiation although, interestingly, linear dose responses for some of the genes studied are obtained at this time point. Furthermore, our study shows that miRNAs miR-34a-5p and miR-182-5p are responsive to radiation exposure in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report that FAS-AS1 lncRNA is up-regulated by radiation exposure in an ATM-dependent fashion in human T lymphocytes.'

aS'Development of Long Noncoding RNA-Based Strategies to Modulate Tissue Vascularization.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding ribonucleic acids (lncRNAs) are a subclass of regulatory noncoding ribonucleic acids for which expression and function in human endothelial cells and angiogenic processes is not well studied.OBJECTIVES: The authors discovered hypoxia-sensitive human lncRNAs via next-generation ribonucleic acid sequencing and microarray approaches. To address their functional importance in angiogenic processes, several endothelial lncRNAs were characterized for their angiogenic characteristics in\xc2\xa0vitro and ex\xc2\xa0vivo.METHODS: Ribonucleic acid sequencing and microarray-derived data showed specific endothelial lncRNA expression changes after hypoxia. Validation experiments confirmed strong hypoxia-dependent activation of 2 intergenic lncRNAs: LINC00323 and MIR503HG.RESULTS: Silencing of these lncRNA transcripts led to angiogenic defects, including repression of growth factor signaling and/or the key endothelial transcription factor GATA2. Endothelial loss of these hypoxia-driven lncRNAs impaired cell-cycle control and inhibited capillary formation. The potential clinical importance of these endothelial lncRNAs to vascular structural integrity was demonstrated in an ex\xc2\xa0vivo model of human induced pluripotent stem cell-based engineered heart tissue.CONCLUSIONS: The authors report an expression atlas of human hypoxia-sensitive lncRNAs and identified 2 lncRNAs with important functions to sustain endothelial cell biology. LncRNAs hold great promise to serve as important future therapeutic targets of cardiovascular disease.'

aS'Decreased long noncoding RNA MIR31HG is correlated with poor prognosis and contributes to cell proliferation in gastric cancer.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators governing fundamental biological processes, and their disorder expression involves in the development of several human cancers. MIR31HG, an lncRNA located in 9p21.3 and 2166\xc2\xa0bp in length, has been found to be upregulated in breast cancer and contributes to cell proliferation and invasion. However, the expression pattern and biological function of MIR31HG in gastric cancer are still not well documented. In this study, we found that MIR31HG expression is decreased in gastric cancer tissues and associated with larger tumor size and advanced pathological stage. Patients with lower MIR31HG expression had a relatively poor prognosis. Furthermore, ectopic over-expression of MIR31HG could inhibit gastric cancer (GC) cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, while knockdown of MIR31HG by small interfering RNA (siRNA) promoted cell proliferation in GC cells partly via regulating E2F1 and p21 expression. Our findings present that decreased MIR31HG is involved in GC development and could be identified as a poor prognostic biomarker in GC patients.'

aS'Novel long non-coding RNA RP11-119F7.4 as a potential biomarker for the development and progression of gastric cancer.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be involved in gene dysregulation in numerous different types of cancer, and have subsequently emerged as a major series of regulatory molecules that participate in a broad range of biological and pathological processes. However, the correlation between the expression levels of lncRNAs and their clinical significance in gastric cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential correlation between lncRNA RP11-119F7.4 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in gastric cancer, and to identify whether it can serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker of the disease. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues of 96 patients with gastric cancer, in addition to matched non-tumor adjacent tissues (NATs). Following reverse transcription, lncRNA RP11-119F7.4 expression levels were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the association with patient clinicopathological characteristics was further analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to determine the diagnostic value of RP11-119F7.4. The results demonstrated that RP11-119F7.4 expression was significantly downregulated in the gastric cancer tissues compared with the matched NATs (P&lt;0.001) and was significantly associated with the macroscopic type (P=0.041) and Lauren grade (P=0.020). The area under the ROC curve was 0.637 (P&lt;0.001). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between RP11-119F7.4 expression and patient survival. The results of the present study indicate that lncRNA RP11-119F7.4 may be involved in carcinogenesis and may prove useful as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic significance in patients with gastric cancer.'

aS'BRAF-Activated Long Noncoding RNA Modulates Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Cell Proliferation through Regulating Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Receptor.\r\nPURPOSE: The importance of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis has recently been demonstrated. However, the role of lncRNAs in development of thyroid cancer remains largely unknown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, expression of three lncRNAs, including BRAF-activated long noncoding RNA (BANCR), papillary thyroid cancer susceptibility candidate 3 (PTCSC3), and noncoding RNA associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and growth arrest (NAMA), was investigated in the current study.RESULTS: Of the three lncRNAs (BANCR, PTCSC3, and NAMA), expression of BANCR was significantly up-regulated while PTCSC3 and NAMA were significantly down-regulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) compared to that in normal tissue. BANCR-knockdown in a PTC-derived cell line (IHH-4) resulted in significant suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). BANCR-knockdown also led to inhibition of cell growth and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase through down-regulation of cyclin D1. In addition, BANCR was enriched by polycomb enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and silencing BANCR led to decreased chromatin recruitment of EZH2, which resulted significantly reduced expression of TSHR.CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that BANCR may contribute to the tumorigenesis of PTC through regulation of cyclin D1 and TSHR.'

aS'Expression of long non-coding RNA DLX6-AS1 in lung adenocarcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), the primary histological type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has displayed an increasing incidence and mortality worldwide. However, therapeutic approaches were limited. Dysregulation of some lncRNAs has been shown in various types of cancers including LAC. The aim of the present study was to vertify lncRNA DLX6-AS1 expression in LAC.METHODS: Microarray assay revealed expression profile of lncRNAs in LAC. qRT-PCR ( quantitative reverse transcription PCR) was performed to identify lncRNA DLX6-AS1 expression level in 72 paired LAC and adjacent normal lung tissues. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to verify that down-regulation lncRNA DLX6-AS1 decreased DLX6 (distal-less homeobox 6) mRNA and protein expression.RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified up-regulation of 272 lncRNAs and down-regulation of 635 lncRNAs in LAC tissues. The expression level of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 in LAC tissues was significantly higher compared to paired adjacent normal lung tissues (P&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). In addition, its expression level was closed correlated with both histological differentiation (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.004) and TNM stage (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.033). qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that DLX6 mRNA and protein levels were lower in si-LncRNA group than in the NC (negative control) and Blank groups.CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis identified that lncRNA DLX6-AS1 was up-regulated in LAC tissues. High DLX6-AS1 expression levels were significantly associated with both histological differentiation and TNM stage. Down-regulation of lncRNA DLX6-AS1 expression decreased the DLX6 mRNA and protein levels.'

aS'SNHG3 correlates with malignant status and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found dysregulated in human disease, especially in cancer. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3) is an lncRNA whose potential function and mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we aimed to determine SNHG3 expression and its clinical significance in HCC. Our results showed that the expression level of SNHG3 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues compared with paired noncancerous tissues from 51 HCC patients, as determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR; P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), which was consistent with the results of two independent HCC cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine databases (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.0001 and P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0325, respectively). These results were further confirmed in 144 paired paraffin-embedded HCC specimens by in situ hybridization assay (ISH). Furthermore, SNHG3 expression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003), portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.014), and relapse (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.038). The high expression level of SNHG3 was markedly correlated with overall survival (OS; P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.0001), recurrence-free survival (RFS; P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.006), and disease-free survival (DFS; P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.0001). More importantly, multivariate analysis indicated that SNHG3 expression was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). In conclusion, increased SNHG3 expression is associated with malignant status and poor prognosis in HCC patients.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA MRUL promotes ABCB1 expression in multidrug-resistant gastric cancer cell sublines.\r\nMultidrug resistance (MDR) is the most common cause of chemotherapy failure in gastric cancer (GC) treatment; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can be involved in carcinogenesis, but the effects of lncRNAs on MDR are poorly understood. We show here that the lncRNA MRUL (MDR-related and upregulated lncRNA), located 400 kb downstream of ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1), was significantly upregulated in two multidrug-resistant GC cell sublines, SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of MRUL in GC tissues were negatively correlated with in vitro growth inhibition rates of GC specimens treated with chemotherapeutic drugs and indicated a poor prognosis for GC patients. MRUL knockdown in SGC7901/ADR and SGC7901/VCR cells led to increased rates of apoptosis, increased accumulation, and reduced doxorubicin (Adriamycin [ADR]) release in the presence of ADR or vincristine. Moreover, MRUL depletion reduced ABCB1 mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Heterologous luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that MRUL might positively affect ABCB1 expression in an orientation- and position-independent manner. Our findings indicate that MRUL promotes ABCB1 expression and is a potential target to reverse the MDR phenotype of GC MDR cell sublines.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA CCAT1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression by functioning as let-7 sponge.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified as having functional roles in cancer biology and are deregulated in many cancers. The present study aimed to determine the expression, roles and functional mechanisms of a long noncoding RNA CCAT1 in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).METHODS: CCAT1 expression levels in 66 pairs of HCC tissues and pair-matched noncancerous hepatic tissues were tested by real-time PCR. The effects of CCAT1 on HCC cells proliferation and migration were assessed using in vitro cell proliferation and migration assays. A computational screen of microRNAs (miRNAs) target sites in CCAT1 was conducted to search for specific miRNAs binding to CCAT1. The specific binding between CCAT1 and miRNAs was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation assay combined with luciferase reporter assay.RESULTS: CCAT1 levels are markedly increased in HCC tissues compared with pair-matched noncancerous hepatic tissues. Up-regulation of CCAT1 is correlated with tumor size, microvascular invasion, AFP and poor prognosis. CCAT1 promotes the proliferation and migration of HCC cells. CCAT1 functions as a molecular sponge for let-7, antagonizes its functions, and leads to the de-repression of its endogenous targets HMGA2 and c-Myc. The effect of CCAT1 on HCC cell proliferation and migration is dependent upon its competitively binding to let-7.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CCAT1 plays a pivotal role in HCC progression via functioning as let-7 sponge, and implicate the potential application of CCAT1 for the prognosis and treatment of HCC.'

aS'Striatal long noncoding RNA Abhd11os is neuroprotective against an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin in vivo.\r\nA large number of gene products that are enriched in the striatum have ill-defined functions, although they may have key roles in age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases affecting the striatum, especially Huntington disease (HD). In the present study, we focused on Abhd11os, (called ABHD11-AS1 in human) which is a putative long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) whose expression is enriched in the mouse striatum. We confirm that despite the presence of 2 small open reading frames (ORFs) in its sequence, Abhd11os is not translated into a detectable peptide in living cells. We demonstrate that Abhd11os levels are markedly reduced in different mouse models of HD. We performed in vivo experiments in mice using lentiviral vectors encoding either Abhd11os or a small hairpin RNA targeting Abhd11os. Results show that Abhd11os overexpression produces neuroprotection against an N-terminal fragment of mutant huntingtin, whereas Abhd11os knockdown is protoxic. These novel results indicate that the loss lncRNA Abhd11os likely contribute to striatal vulnerability in HD. Our study emphasizes that lncRNA may play crucial roles in neurodegenerative diseases.'

aS'Differentiation of mammary tumors and reduction in metastasis upon Malat1 lncRNA loss.\r\nGenome-wide analyses have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Malat1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant lncRNAs whose expression is altered in numerous cancers. Here we report that genetic loss or systemic knockdown of Malat1 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-PyMT mouse mammary carcinoma model results in slower tumor growth accompanied by significant differentiation into cystic tumors and a reduction in metastasis. Furthermore, Malat1 loss results in a reduction of branching morphogenesis in MMTV-PyMT- and Her2/neu-amplified tumor organoids, increased cell adhesion, and loss of migration. At the molecular level, Malat1 knockdown results in alterations in gene expression and changes in splicing patterns of genes involved in differentiation and protumorigenic signaling pathways. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time a functional role of Malat1 in regulating critical processes in mammary cancer pathogenesis. Thus, Malat1 represents an exciting therapeutic target, and Malat1 ASOs represent a potential therapy for inhibiting breast cancer progression.'

aS'Detection of the long noncoding RNAs nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1 (NEAT1) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 in the peripheral blood of HIV-1-infected patients.\r\nOBJECTIVES: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HIV-1 infection have not been extensively studied. Here we detected two lncRNAs, nuclear-enriched autosomal transcript 1 (NEAT1) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma of HIV-1-infected patients.METHODS: Fifty-nine HIV-1-infected patients and 21 healthy controls were recruited for the study, of whom 31 patients were highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-na\xc3\xafve and 28 patients had been receiving HAART for more than 1 year with undetectable viral loads. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs and plasma, and levels of NEAT1 and MALAT1 were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: We found that the levels of NEAT1 and MALAT1 in PBMCs were up-regulated in HAART-na\xc3\xafve patients and were reduced in patients receiving HAART. NEAT1 was down-regulated in the plasma of infected patients and expression was correlated with CD4 T-cell count.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NEAT1 and MALAT1 may interact with HIV-1 in vivo and that the presence of NEAT1 in plasma is a potential biomarker of HIV-1 infection.'

aS"Long non-coding RNA CCAT1 promotes gallbladder cancer development via negative modulation of miRNA-218-5p.\r\nProtein-coding genes account for only ~2% of the human genome, whereas the vast majority of transcripts are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). A growing volume of literature has proposed that lncRNAs are important factors in cancer. Colon cancer-associated transcript-1 (CCAT1), an lncRNA, which was first identified in colon cancer, was previously shown to promote tumor development and be a negative prognostic factor in gastric cancer. However, the mechanism through which CCAT1 exerts its oncogenic activity remains largely unknown. Recently, a novel regulatory mechanism has been proposed in which RNAs can cross-talk with each other via competing shared for microRNAs (miRNAs). The proposed competitive endogenous RNAs could mediate the bioavailability of miRNAs on their targets, thus imposing another level of posttranscriptional regulation. In this study, we demonstrated that CCAT1 was upregulated in gallbladder cancer (GBC) tissues. CCAT1 silencing downregulated, whereas CCAT1 overexpression enhanced the expression of miRNA-218-5p target gene Bmi1 through competitively 'spongeing' miRNA-218-5p. Our data revealed that CCAT1 knockdown impaired the proliferation and invasiveness of GBC cells, at least in part through affecting miRNA-218-5p-mediated regulation of Bmi1. Moreover, CCAT1 transcript level was correlated with Bmi1 mRNA level in GBC tissues. Together, these results suggest that CCAT1 is a driver of malignancy, which acts in part through 'spongeing' miRNA-218-5p."

aS'Prognostic significance of long non-coding RNA PCAT-1 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play widespread roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. However, the functional roles of lncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are not yet well elucidated. The aim of the present study was to measure the levels of lncRNA PCAT-1 expression in HCC and evaluate its clinical significance in the development and progression of HCC.METHODS: We examined the expression of PCAT-1 in 117 HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues using quantitative real-time-PCR and analyzed its correlation with the clinical parameters.RESULTS: Our data showed that PCAT-1 expression in HCC tissues was significantly increased compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P&lt;0.05). Up-regulated expression of PCAT-1 was significantly associated with TNM stage and metastasis (P&lt;0.05), but not other clinical parameters. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a high expression level of PCAT-1 resulted in a significantly poor overall survival of HCC patients. The multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that PCAT-1 expression level was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival rate of HCC patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the increased expression of PCAT-1 was associated with advanced clinical parameters and poor overall survival of HCC patients, indicating that PCAT-1 up-regulation may serve as a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in HCC patients.'

aS'Circulation long non-coding RNAs act as biomarkers for predicting tumorigenesis and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Alpha Fetal Protein (AFP) was one of the traditional biomarker for diagnosis of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinically, however, with the low specificity of AFP, the early diagnosis or the metastasis prediction of HCC is inferior. A new, minimally invasive and more specificity biomarker for the diagnosis or metastasis prediction of HCC are necessary.METHODS: In this study, we applied an lncRNA microarray to screen the potential biomarker for HCC. The multi-stage validation and risk score formula detection was used for validation.RESULTS: We discovered three lncRNA, RP11-160H22.5, XLOC_014172 and LOC149086, which were up-regulated in HCC comparing with the cancer-free controls with the merged area under curve (AUC) in training set and validation set of 0.999 and 0.896. Furthermore, XLOC_014172 and LOC149086 was confirmed highly increased in metastasis HCC patients with the merged AUC in training set and validation set of 0.900 and 0.934. Besides, most patients presented a decreased level of the three lncRNAs after operation, while the patients with secondary increased level might be associated with tumor hematogenous metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: RP11-160H22.5, XLOC_014172 and LOC149086 might be the potential biomarker for the tumorigenesis prediction and XLOC_014172 and LOC149086 for metastasis prediction in the future.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA GAS5: a novel marker involved in glucocorticoid response.\r\nGlucocorticoids (GCs) exert their effects through regulation of gene expression after activation in the cytoplasm of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) encoded by NR3C1 gene. A negative feedback mechanism resulting in GR autoregulation has been demonstrated through the binding of the activated receptor to intragenic sequences called GRE-like elements, contained in GR gene. The long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) interacts with the activated GR suppressing its transcriptional activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of GAS5 and NR3C1 gene expression in the antiproliferative effect of methylprednisolone in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to correlate the expression with individual sensitivity to GCs. Subjects being poor responders to GCs presented higher levels of GAS5 and NR3C1 in comparison with good responders. We suggest that abnormal levels of GAS5 may alter GC effectiveness, probably interfering with the mechanism of GR autoregulation.'

aS'Expression Signatures of Long Noncoding RNAs in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.\r\nPURPOSE: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the most common pediatric spinal deformity, is considered a complex genetic disease. Causing genes and pathogenesis of AIS are still unclear. This study was designed to identify differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involving the pathogenesis of AIS.METHODS: We first performed comprehensive screening of lncRNA and mRNA in AIS patients and healthy children using Agilent human lncRNA + mRNA Array V3.0 microarray. LncRNAs expression in different AIS patients was further evaluated using quantitative PCR.RESULTS: A total of 139 lncRNAs and 546 mRNAs were differentially expressed between AIS patients and healthy control. GO and Pathway analysis showed that these mRNAs might be involved in bone mineralization, neuromuscular junction, skeletal system morphogenesis, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, and regulation of signal pathway. Four lncRNAs (ENST00000440778.1, ENST00000602322.1, ENST00000414894.1, and TCONS_00028768) were differentially expressed between different patients when grouped according to age, height, classification, severity of scoliosis, and Risser grade.CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the abnormal expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs in AIS, and the expression of some lncRNAs was related to clinical features. This study is helpful for further understanding of lncRNAs in pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of AIS.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA derived from CD244 signaling epigenetically controls CD8+ T-cell immune responses in tuberculosis infection.\r\nMolecular mechanisms for T-cell immune responses modulated by T cell-inhibitory molecules during tuberculosis (TB) infection remain unclear. Here, we show that active human TB infection up-regulates CD244 and CD244 signaling-associated molecules in CD8(+) T cells and that blockade of CD244 signaling enhances production of IFN-\xce\xb3 and TNF-\xce\xb1. CD244 expression/signaling in TB correlates with high levels of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-BC050410 [named as lncRNA-AS-GSTT1(1-72) or lncRNA-CD244] in the CD244(+)CD8(+) T-cell subpopulation. CD244 signaling drives lncRNA-CD244 expression via sustaining a permissive chromatin state in the lncRNA-CD244 locus. By recruiting polycomb protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) to infg/tnfa promoters, lncRNA-CD244 mediates H3K27 trimethylation at infg/tnfa loci toward repressive chromatin states and inhibits IFN-\xce\xb3/TNF-\xce\xb1 expression in CD8(+) T cells. Such inhibition can be reversed by knock down of lncRNA-CD244. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of lncRNA-CD244-depressed CD8(+) T cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-infected mice reduced MTB infection and TB pathology compared with lncRNA-CD244-expressed controls. Thus, this work uncovers previously unidentified mechanisms in which T cell-inhibitory signaling and lncRNAs regulate T-cell responses and host defense against TB infection.'

aS'Increased level of H19 long noncoding RNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells.\r\nOBJECT Increased levels of H19 long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) have been observed in many cancers, suggesting that overexpression of H19 may be important in the development of carcinogenesis. However, the role of H19 in human glioblastoma is still unclear. The object of this study was to examine the level of H19 in glioblastoma samples and investigate the role of H19 in glioblastoma carcinogenesis. METHODS Glioblastoma and nontumor brain tissue specimens were obtained from tissue obtained during tumor resection in 30 patients with glioblastoma. The level of H19 lncRNA was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The role of H19 in invasion, angiogenesis, and stemness of glioblastoma cells was then investigated using commercially produced cell lines (U87 and U373). The effects of H19 overexpression on glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis were detected by in vitro Matrigel invasion and endothelial tube formation assay. The effects of H19 on glioblastoma cell stemness and tumorigenicity were investigated by neurosphere formation and an in vivo murine xenograft model. RESULTS The authors found that H19 is significantly overexpressed in glioblastoma tissues, and the level of expression was associated with patient survival. In the subsequent investigations, the authors found that overexpression of H19 promotes glioblastoma cell invasion and angiogenesis in vitro. Interestingly, H19 was also significantly overexpressed in CD133(+) glioblastoma cells, and overexpression of H19 was associated with increased neurosphere formation of glioblastoma cells. Finally, stable overexpression of H19 was associated with increased tumor growth in the murine xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that increased expression of H19 lncRNA promotes invasion, angiogenesis, stemness, and tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that H19 plays an important role in tumorigenicity and stemness of glioblastoma and thus could be a therapeutic target for treatment of glioblastoma in the future.'

aS'Long intervening non-coding RNA 00320 is human brain-specific and highly expressed in the cortical white matter.\r\nPervasive transcription of the genome produces a diverse array of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). One particular class of ncRNAs, long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are thought to play a role in regulating gene expression and may be a major contributor to organism and tissue complexity. The human brain with its heterogeneous cellular make-up is a rich source of lincRNAs; however, the functions of the majority of lincRNAs are unknown. Recently, by completing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the human frontal cortex, we identified linc00320 as being highly expressed in the white matter compared to grey matter in multiple system atrophy (MSA) brain. Here, we further investigate the expression patterns of linc00320 and conclude that it is involved in specific brain regions rather than having involvement in the MSA disease process. We also show that the full-length linc00320 is only expressed in human brain tissue and not in other primates, suggesting that it may be involved in improved functional connectivity for higher human brain cognition.'

aS'Long non-coding RNAs expression profile in HepG2 cells reveals the potential role of long non-coding RNAs in the cholesterol metabolism.\r\nBACKGROUND: Green tea has been shown to improve cholesterol metabolism in animal studies, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this function have not been fully understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as a major class of regulatory molecules involved in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases. Our aim was to identify important lncRNAs that might play an important role in contributing to the benefits of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on cholesterol metabolism.METHODS: Microarrays was used to reveal the lncRNA and mRNA profiles in green tea polyphenol(-)-epigallocatechin gallate in cultured human liver (HepG2) hepatocytes treated with EGCG and bioinformatic analyses of the predicted target genes were performed to identify lncRNA-mRNA targeting relationships. RNA interference was used to investigate the role of lncRNAs in cholesterol metabolism.RESULTS: The expression levels of 15 genes related to cholesterol metabolism and 285 lncRNAs were changed by EGCG treatment. Bioinformatic analysis found five matched lncRNA-mRNA pairs for five differentially expressed lncRNAs and four differentially expressed mRNA. In particular, the lncRNA AT102202 and its potential targets mRNA-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) were identified. Using a real-time polymerase chain reaction technique, we confirmed that EGCG down-regulated mRNA expression level of the HMGCR and up-regulated expression of AT102202. After AT102202 knockdown in HepG2, we observed that the level of HMGCR expression was significantly increased relative to the scrambled small interfering RNA control (P &lt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that EGCG improved cholesterol metabolism and meanwhile changed the lncRNAs expression profile in HepG2 cells. LncRNAs may play an important role in the cholesterol metabolism.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA deregulation in tongue squamous cell carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: The deregulated tumorigenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has been reported in several malignancies. However, there is still no comprehensive study on tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).METHODS: Functional reannotation for the human lncRNA was carried out by ncFANs. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to validate the identified lncRNAs.RESULTS: Using the functional annotation algorithm from ncFANs, 8 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified. Lnc-PPP2R4-5, lnc-SPRR2D-1, lnc-MAN1A2-1, lnc-FAM46A-1, lnc-MBL2-4:1, and lnc-MBL2-4:3 were upregulated in the microdissected tongue SCC tissues. In comparison, lnc-AL355149.1-1 and lnc-STXBP5-1 showed significant downregulation. High level of lnc-MBL2-4:3 was significantly associated with the node positive tongue SCC patients. Further, patients with advanced T-stage demonstrated a further reduction of lnc-AL355149.1-1 in the tumor tissues. Treatment of tongue SCC cells with 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel can reserve the expression patterns observed in the tongue SCC tissues. Further, changes of lnc-MBL2-4:3 and lnc-AL355149.1-1 expression levels were noticed in the cisplatin-resistant tongue SCC cells.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that functional reannotation allows us to identify novel lncRNAs using the existing gene expression array dataset. The association of lncRNA with the T-stage and nodal status of tongue SCC patients suggested that lncRNA deregulation was involved in the pathogenesis of tongue SCC.'

aS'A novel long noncoding RNA LINC01133 is upregulated in lung squamous cell cancer and predicts survival.\r\nLung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and lung squamous cell cancer (LSCC) are two major histological types of non-small cell lung cancer. LSCC differs greatly from LAD in many aspects. Accumulating evidence has shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in the process of carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Expression of lncRNA is highly tissue-specific and could be biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Here, we identified differentially expressed lncRNA between LSCC and LAD by data mining of Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. A set of 1646 differentially expressed lncRNA transcripts were identified. Among these lncRNAs, a novel lncRNA, LINC01133, showed the largest fold change among large intergenic noncoding RNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay confirmed that LINC01133 was upregulated in LSCC (increasing fold 6.4, P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) but not in the LAD samples. LSCC patients with higher expression level of LINC01133 had shorter survival time (hazard ratio\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.383; 95 % confidence interval 1.023-5.547, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.044). Wound-healing and transwell assays demonstrated that silence of LINC01133 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited invasion ability of LSCC cell line. Thus, a set of lncRNA was differentially expressed between LAD and LSCC and could serve as potential biomarkers.'

aS'Increased levels of the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA POU3F3 promote DNA methylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.\r\nBACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Thousands of long intergenic non-protein coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals via genome-wide sequencing studies. Many are functional, but are expressed aberrantly by cancer cells. We investigated whether levels of lincRNAs are altered during the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).METHODS: We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure levels of 26 highly conserved lincRNAs in ESCC and surrounding nontumor tissues. A total of 182 ESCC and paired adjacent nontumor tissue samples were collected from patients undergoing tylectomy at The First Affiliate Hospital of Soochow University from 2001 through 2009; another 178 ESCC tissue pairs were collected from Guangzhou Medical University from 2002 through 2009. LincRNAs were expressed from lentiviral vectors or knocked down with small hairpin RNAs in Eca-109 and TE-1 cells.RESULTS: Levels of a lincRNA encoded by a gene located next to POU3F3 (linc-POU3F3) were significantly higher in ESCC than neighboring nontumor tissues. In RNA immunoprecipitation assays, linc-POU3F3 was associated with the EZH2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Overexpression of linc-POU3F3 in cell lines increased their proliferation and ability to form colonies, and reduced the expression of POU3F3 mRNA, whereas knockdown of linc-POU3F3 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA. CpG islands in POU3F3 were densely hypermethylated in cell lines that overexpressed linc-POU3F3; methylation at these sites was reduced by knockdown of linc-POU3F3. Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 increased the levels of POU3F3 mRNA and significantly reduced binding of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B to POU3F3. ESCC cells with knockdown of linc-POU3F3 formed xenograft tumors more slowly in mice than control ESCC cells.CONCLUSIONS: Levels of linc-POU3F3 are increased in ESCC samples from patients compared with nontumor tissues. This noncoding RNA contributes to the development of ESCC by interacting with EZH2 to promote methylation of POU3F3, which encodes a transcription factor.'

aS"Attenuated ability of BACE1 to cleave the amyloid precursor protein via silencing long noncoding RNA BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS expression.\r\nAlthough large numbers of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expressed in the mammalian nervous system have been detected, their functions and mechanisms of regulation remain to be fully clarified. It has been reported that the lncRNA antisense transcript for \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x91secretase\xe2\x80\x911 (BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS) is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and drives the rapid feed\xe2\x80\x91forward regulation of \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x91secretase, suggesting that it is critical in AD development. In the present study, the senile plaque (SP) AD SH\xe2\x80\x91SY5Y cell model was established using the synthetic amyloid \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x91protein (A\xce\xb2) 1\xe2\x80\x9142 in vitro. Using this model, the potential of siRNA\xe2\x80\x91mediated silencing of lncRNA BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS expression to attenuate the ability of \xce\xb2\xe2\x80\x91secretase\xe2\x80\x911 (BACE1) to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and to reduce the production of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9142 oligomers was investigated. MTT assays demonstrated that exogenous A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9142 suppressed SH\xe2\x80\x91SY5Y cell proliferation and induced APP\xe2\x80\x91related factor expression and SP formation. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9142 and A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9140 was significantly increased in the AD model group, with a marked decrease in Ki\xe2\x80\x9167 expression at day six. RNase protection assays (RPA) and northern blotting analysis confirmed that exogenous A\xce\xb21\xe2\x80\x9142 not only promoted the expression of the APP\xe2\x80\x91cleaving enzyme BACE1, but also induced lncRNA BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS expression. Furthermore, lncRNA BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS formed RNA duplexes and increased the stability of BACE1 mRNA. Downregulation of lncRNA BACE1\xe2\x80\x91AS expression in SH\xe2\x80\x91SY5Y cells by siRNA silencing resulted in the attenuation of the ability of BACE1 to cleave APP and delayed the induction of SP formation in the SP AD SH\xe2\x80\x91SY5Y cell model."

aS'Circulating long noncoding RNA GAS5 levels are correlated to prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.\r\nBACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a metabolic disease, is characterized by impaired fasting glucose levels. Type 2 DM is adult onset diabetes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression and multiple studies have linked lncRNAs to human diseases.METHODS: Serum samples obtained from 96 participating veterans at JAH VA were deposited in the Research Biospecimen Repository. We used a two-stage strategy to identify an lncRNA whose levels correlated with T2DM. Initially we screened five serum samples from diabetic and non-diabetic individuals using lncRNA arrays. Next, GAS5 lncRNA levels were analyzed in 96 serum samples using quantitative PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the optimal cutoff GAS5 for diagnosis of DM.RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that decreased GAS5 levels in serum were associated with diabetes in a cohort of US military veterans. The ROC analysis revealed an optimal cutoff GAS5 value of less than or equal to 10. qPCR results indicated that individuals with absolute GAS5\xc2\xa0&lt;\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0ng/\xce\xbcl have almost twelve times higher odds of having diabetes (Exact Odds Ratio [OR]\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa011.79 (95% CI: 3.97, 37.26), p\xc2\xa0&lt;\xc2\xa00.001). Analysis indicated area under curve (AUC) of ROC of 0.81 with 85.1% sensitivity and 67.3% specificity in distinguishing non-diabetic from diabetic subjects. The positive predictive value is 71.4%.CONCLUSION: lncRNA GAS5 levels are correlated to prevalence of T2DM.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Assessment of GAS5 in serum along with other parameters offers greater accuracy in identifying individuals at-risk for diabetes.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA UCA1 induces non-T790M acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.\r\nThe aim of this study was to explore the role of long non-coding RNA UCA1 (urothelial cancer-associated 1) in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our study, UCA1 expression was significantly increased in lung cancer cells and patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Over-expression of UCA1 was significantly associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) [13.0 vs. 8.5 months, P &lt; 0.01] in tumors with respond to EGFR-TKIs. The significant relationship was not observed in patients with T790M mutation (10.5 vs. 12.0 months, P = 0.778), but in patients with non-T790M (19.0 vs. 9.0 months, P = 0.023). UCA1 knockdown restored gefitinib sensitivity in acquired resistant cells with non-T790M and inhibited the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mTOR inhibitor was effective in UCA1-expressing cell PC9/R. Inhibiting mTOR could change the expression of UCA1, although there was no significant difference. In conclusion, the influence of over-expression of UCA1 on PFS for patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs was from the subgroup with non-T790M mutation. UCA1 may induce non-T790M acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway and EMT.'

aS"LncRNA-UCA1 exerts oncogenic functions in non-small cell lung cancer by targeting miR-193a-3p.\r\nRecently, the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been identified as an oncogenic gene in multiple human tumor entitles, and dysregulation of UCA1 was tightly linked to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. However, whether the aberrant expression of UCA1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with malignancy, metastasis or prognosis has not been characterized. In this study, we found that UCA1 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues. Higher expression of UCA1 led to a significantly poorer survival time, and multivariate analysis revealed that UCA1 was an independent risk factor of prognosis. UCA1 overexpression enhanced, whereas UCA1 silencing impaired the proliferation and colony formation of NSCLC cells. Moreover, mechanistic investigations showed that UCA1 upregulated the expression of miR-193a-3p target gene ERBB4 through competitively 'spongeing' miR-193a-3p. Overall, we concluded that UCA1 functions as an oncogene in NSCLC, acting mechanistically by upregulating ERBB4 in part through 'spongeing' miR-193a-3p."

aS'Antisense Long Noncoding RNA HIF1A-AS2 Is Upregulated in Gastric Cancer and Associated with Poor Prognosis.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently shown to play important regulatory roles in fundamental biological processes, and many of them are deregulated in several human cancers. LncRNA hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha antisense RNA-2 (HIF1A-AS2) is overexpressed in nonpapillary clear-cell renal carcinomas and involved in cancer progression.AIM: This study was to evaluate the expression of HIF1A-AS2 in gastric cancer (GC) and further explore its biological function in GC cells.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression level of HIF1A-AS2 in GC tissues. The correlation of its expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC(AUC)) was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of HIF1A-AS2. Besides, tumor cell proliferation was assessed following knockdown of HIF1A-AS2, by MTT and colony formation assay in vitro, and tumor formation assay in a nude mouse model in vivo.RESULTS: The expression of HIF1A-AS2 was upregulated in GC tumorous tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Its overexpression was correlated with TNM stages (P = 0.008), tumor invasion (P = 0.016), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.042), and poor prognosis (P = 0.001). In addition, ROC(AUC) of HIF1A-AS2 was up to 0.673 (95 % CI 0.596-0.744, P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, knockdown of HIF1A-AS2 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.CONCLUSIONS: HIF1A-AS2 is overexpressed in GC and may play a pivotal role in tumor cell proliferation. It can be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for GC.'

aS'The long non-coding RNA lnc-ZNF180-2 is a prognostic biomarker in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\r\nClear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is among the most common human malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) regulate various cellular functions and have been implicated in ccRCC pathogenesis. In order to decipher the molecular biology of this tumor and to identify potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, we re-evaluated published lncRNA expression profiling data. An expression profile of 49 lncRNAs allowed discrimination of localized and advanced ccRCC. The expression profile of six lncRNAs transcripts (lnc-ACO1625, lnc-CYP4A22-2/3, lnc-PEAK1.1-1, lnc-PCYOX1L, lnc-VCAN-1, lnc-ZNF180-2) with potential prognostic interest were validated in a cohort of 50 normal renal, 57 localized ccRCC and 45 advanced ccRCC tissues. lnc-ZNF180-2 levels were similar in localized ccRCC and normal renal tissue, but we observed a significant increase of lnc-ZNF180-2 expression in advanced ccRCC tissue. Furthermore, lnc-ZNF180-2 expression levels were an independent predictor of progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival and overall survival in ccRCC patients. We also observed that lnc-CYP4A22-2/3 expression levels allowed discrimination of ccRCC and normal renal tissue. In conclusion, lncRNAs are involved in renal carcinogenesis, and quantification of lnc-ZNF180-2 may be useful for the prediction of ccRCC patients outcome following nephrectomy.'

aS'Pint lincRNA connects the p53 pathway with  epigenetic silencing by the Polycomb repressive  complex 2.\r\nBACKGROUND: The p53 transcription factor is located at the core of a complex wiring of signaling pathways that are critical for the preservation of cellular homeostasis. Only recently it has become clear that p53 regulates the expression of several long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). However, relatively little is known about the role that lincRNAs play in this pathway.RESULTS: Here we characterize a lincRNA named Pint (p53 induced noncoding transcript). We show that Pint is aubiquitously expressed lincRNA that is finely regulated by p53. In mouse cells, Pint promotes cell proliferation and survival by regulating the expression of genes of the TGF-b, MAPK and p53 pathways. Pint is a nuclear lincRNA that directly interacts with the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and is required for PRC2 targeting of specific genes for H3K27 tri-methylation and repression. Furthermore, Pint functional activity is highly dependent on PRC2 expression. We have also identified Pint human ortholog (PINT), which presents suggestive analogies with the murine lincRNA. PINT is similarly regulated by p53, and its expression significantly correlates with the same cellular pathways as the mouse ortholog, including the p53 pathway. Interestingly, PINT is downregulated in colon primary tumors, while its overexpression inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells, suggesting a possible role as tumor suppressor.CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a p53 autoregulatory negative mechanism where a lincRNA connects p53 activation with epigenetic silencing by PRC2. Additionally, we show analogies and differences between the murine and human orthologs, identifying a novel tumor suppressor candidate lincRNA.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA PVT1 is associated with tumor progression and predicts recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.\r\nPVT1, which maps to chromosome 8q24, is a copy number amplification-associated long non-coding RNA. Overexpression of PVT1 is a powerful predictor of tumor progression and patient survival in a diverse range of cancer types. However, the association between PVT1 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression pattern of PVT1, and its clinical significance in HCC. Between 2003 and 2012, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression levels of PVT1 in two independent cohorts: Cohort one, 58 HCC resection samples; and cohort 2, 214 HCC transplant samples. Additionally, the correlation between PVT1 expression levels and clinical parameters and outcomes was analyzed. The relative expression levels of PVT1 were significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared with the corresponding non-cancerous tissues (cohort one, P=0.0016; cohort two, P=0.0274). Furthermore, overexpression of PVT1 was associated with a higher serum \xce\xb1-fetoprotein expression level (P=0.011) and a higher recurrence rate (P=0.004). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the patients with high PVT1 expression exhibited poor recurrence-free survival (P=0.021), and multivariate analysis demonstrated that high levels of PVT1 expression are an independent predictor for HCC recurrence (P=0.042; hazard ratio, 1.653). Thus, the high expression levels of PVT1 in HCC may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence in HCC patients, and as a potential therapeutic target.'

aS'A novel mitosis-associated lncRNA, MA-linc1, is required for cell cycle progression and sensitizes cancer cells to Paclitaxel.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are major regulators of many cellular processes including cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this study, we identify a novel lncRNA, MA-linc1, and reveal its effects on cell cycle progression and cancer growth. Inhibition of MA-linc1 expression alters cell cycle distribution, leading to a decrease in the number of G1 cells and a concomitant increase in all other stages of the cell cycle, and in particular G2/M, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of M phase. Accordingly, knock down of MA-linc1 inhibits M phase exit upon release from a mitotic block. We further demonstrate that MA-linc1 predominantly functions in cis to repress expression of its neighboring gene, Pur\xce\xb1, which is often deleted in human cancers and whose ectopic expression inhibits cell cycle progression. Knock down of Pur\xce\xb1 partially rescues the MA-linc1 dependent inhibition of M phase exit. In agreement with its suggested role in M phase, inhibition of MA-linc1 enhances apoptotic cell death induced by the antimitotic drug, Paclitaxel and this enhancement of apoptosis is rescued by Pur\xce\xb1 knockdown. Furthermore, high levels of MA-linc1 are associated with reduced survival in human breast and lung cancer patients.Taken together, our data identify MA-linc1 as a novel lncRNA regulator of cell cycle and demonstrate its potential role in cancer progression and treatment.'

aS"CRNDE affects the malignant biological characteristics of human glioma stem cells by negatively regulating miR-186.\r\nThe long non-coding RNA Colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is a novel gene that activated early in colorectal neoplasia, but it is also up-regulated in many other solid tumors. Herein, the function and underlying mechanism of CRNDE in regulating glioma stem cells (GSCs) were investigated. We found that CRNDE expression was up-regulated while miR-186 expression was down-regulated in GSCs. Overexpression of CRNDE could promote the cellular proliferation, migration, invasion and inhibit the apoptosis in GSCs. Overexpression of miR-186 exerted functions of inhibiting the proliferation, migration and invasion of GSCs and promoting apoptosis. And CRNDE decreased the expression levels of XIAP and PAK7 by binding to miR-186 and negatively regulating it. In addition, miR-186 binded to XIAP and PAK7 3'UTR region, and decrease the expression of them, thus regulating the expression levels of downstream target proteins such as caspase 3, BAD, cyclin D1 and MARK2. The in vivo effect of CRNDE and miR-186 showed that the tumor formation rate was minimum in tumor-bearing nude mice with the knockdown of CRNDE and the overexpression of miR-186. In conclusion, CRNDE played an oncogenic role of GSCs through the negative regulation of miR-186. Both CRNDE and miR-186 could be regarded as potential targets in the glioma therapy."

aS'Deletion of the noncoding GNAS antisense transcript causes pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib and biparental defects of GNAS methylation in cis.\r\nCONTEXT: GNAS encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein as well as additional imprinted transcripts including the maternally expressed NESP55 and the paternally expressed XLalphas, antisense, and A/B transcripts. Most patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ib (PHP-Ib) exhibit imprinting defects affecting the maternal GNAS allele, which are thought to reduce/abolish Gsalpha expression in renal proximal tubules and thereby cause resistance to PTH.OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to define the genetic defect in a previously unreported family with autosomal dominant PHP-Ib.DESIGN AND SETTING: Analyses of serum and urine chemistries and of genomic DNA and lymphoblastoid-derived RNA were conducted at a tertiary hospital and research laboratory.PATIENTS: Affected individuals presented with muscle weakness and/or paresthesia and showed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated serum PTH. Obligate carriers were healthy and revealed no obvious abnormality in mineral ion homeostasis.RESULTS: A novel 4.2-kb microdeletion was discovered in the affected individuals and the obligate carriers, ablating two noncoding GNAS antisense exons while preserving the NESP55 exon. On maternal transmission, the deletion causes loss of all maternal GNAS imprints, partial gain of NESP55 methylation, and PTH resistance. Paternal transmission of the mutation leads to epigenetic alterations in cis, including a partial loss of NESP55 methylation and a partial gain of A/B methylation.CONCLUSIONS: The identified deletion points to a unique cis-acting element located telomeric of the NESP55 exon that is critical for imprinting both GNAS alleles. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PHP and GNAS imprinting.'

aS'Biological significance of long non-coding RNA FTX expression in human colorectal cancer.\r\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FTX and analyze its prognostic and biological significance in colorectal cancer (CRC). A quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to detect the expression of long non-coding RNA FTX in 35 pairs of colorectal cancer and corresponding noncancerous tissues. The expression of long non-coding RNA FTX was detected in 187 colorectal cancer tissues and its correlations with clinicopathological factors of patients were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to analyze the prognostic significance of Long Non-coding RNA FTX expression. The effects of long non-coding RNA FTX expression on malignant phenotypes of colorectal cancer cells and its possible biological significances were further determined. Long non-coding RNA FTX was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues, and low long non-coding RNA FTX expression was significantly correlated with differentiation grade, lymph vascular invasion, and clinical stage. Patients with high long non-coding RNA FTX showed poorer overall survival than those with low long non-coding RNA FTX. Multivariate analyses indicated that status of long non-coding RNA FTX was an independent prognostic factor for patients. Functional analyses showed that upregulation of long non-coding RNA FTX significantly promoted growth, migration, invasion, and increased colony formation in colorectal cancer cells. Therefore, long non-coding RNA FTX may be a potential biomarker for predicting the survival of colorectal cancer patients and might be a molecular target for treatment of human colorectal cancer.'

aS'Genome-wide analysis of long noncoding RNA profile in human gastric epithelial cell response to Helicobacter pylori.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes, and their misregulation has been shown in various types of diseases. However, the relationship between lncRNAs and the immune response to pathogen infection has been rarely reported. Helicobacter pylori is a major human pathogenic bacterium that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. The regulatory mechanism of the H. pylori-induced immune response is not yet clear. In the present study, we identified nonoverlapping signatures of a small number of lncRNAs that were aberrantly expressed in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells using microarray analysis followed by bioassays. From microarray data, we found that 23 lncRNAs were upregulated and 21 were downregulated. Five lncRNAs, XLOC_004562, XLOC_005912, XLOC_000620, XLOC_004122, and XLOC_014388, were further evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and the results matched well with microarray data. In addition, XLOC_004122 and XLOC_014388 were decreased in gastric mucosal tissues of H. pylori-positive patients. Differentially expressed lncRNAs may play a partial or key role in the immune response to H. pylori, and this may provide potential targets for the future treatment of H. pylori-related diseases.'

aS'Downregulation of the long noncoding RNA EGOT correlates with malignant status and poor prognosis in breast cancer.\r\nEosinophil granule ontogeny transcript (EGOT) is a long noncoding RNA involved in the regulation of eosinophil granule protein transcript expression. However, little is known about the role of EGOT in malignant disease. This study aimed to assess the potential role of EGOT in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression levels of EGOT in 250 breast cancerous tissues and 50 adjacent noncancerous tissues. The correlation of EGOT expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis was also analyzed. EGOT expression was lower in breast cancer compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), and low levels of EGOT expression were significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.022), more lymph node metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.020), and higher Ki-67 expression (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.017). Moreover, patients with low levels of EGOT expression showed significantly worse prognosis for overall survival (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.040), and this result was further validated in a larger cohort from a public database. Multivariate analysis suggested that low levels of EGOT were a poor independent prognostic predictor for breast cancer patients (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.857, 95 % CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.032-3.340, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.039). In conclusion, EGOT may play an important role in breast cancer progression and prognosis and may serve as a new potential prognostic target in breast cancer patients.'

aS'Integrated analysis of long noncoding RNAs and mRNAs reveals their potential roles in the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas.\r\nGlobal expression profiling studies showed that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in uterine leiomyomas (ULMs) and are involved in ULM pathogenesis. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are another group of regulatory RNA whose expression and roles in ULMs have not been explored. In this study, we examined the global expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs in ULMs using microarray and interrogated their interrelationship through co-expression analysis. We found that lncRNAs and mRNAs were dysregulated in ULMs and the degree of dysregulation was positively correlated with tumor size. Further analysis showed that lncRNAs correlate to their cis mRNAs in expression levels depending on genomic locations and orientations. Moreover, we identified several dysregulated pathways that were correlated to dysregulated lncRNAs. We validated several aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in extended samples and confirmed that AK023096 was down-regulated and chromatin-associated RNA (CAR) Intergenic 10 was up-regulated in the majority of leiomyomas. Knockdown of Intergenic 10 inhibited the proliferation of leiomyoma cells in vitro, indicating its functional importance in ULM pathogenesis. The neighboring protein-coding gene ADAM12 was also downregulated in Intergenic 10 knockdown leiomyoma cells. We showed for the first time that lncRNAs were dysregulated in uterine leiomyomas. Aberrantly expressed lncRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of uterine leiomyomas.'

aS'Using gastric juice lncRNA-ABHD11-AS1 as a novel type of biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play vital roles in tumorigenesis. However, the diagnostic values of most lncRNAs are largely unknown. To investigate whether gastric juice lncRNA-ABHD11-AS1 can be a potential biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer, 173 tissue samples and 130 gastric juice from benign lesion, gastric dysplasia, gastric premalignant lesions, and gastric cancer were collected. ABHD11-AS1 levels were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Then, the relationships between ABHD11-AS1 levels and clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer were investigated. The results showed that ABHD11-AS1 levels in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in other tissues. Its levels in gastric juice from gastric cancer patients were not only significantly higher than those from cases of normal mucosa or minimal gastritis, atrophic gastritis, and gastric ulcers but also associated with gender, tumor size, tumor stage, Lauren type, and blood carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. More importantly, when using gastric juice ABHD11-AS1 as a marker, the positive detection rate of early gastric cancer patients was reached to 71.4\xc2\xa0%. Thanks to the special origin of gastric juice, these results indicate that gastric juice ABHD11-AS1 may be a potential biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA TUG1 is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes cell growth and apoptosis by epigenetically silencing of KLF2.\r\nBACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide, and the biology of this cancer remains poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are found to be dysregulated in a variety of cancers, including HCC. Taurine Up-regulated Gene 1 (TUG1), a 7.1-kb lncRNA, recruiting and binding to polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is found to be disregulated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, its clinical significance and potential role in HCC remain unclear.METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, expression of TUG1 was analyzed in 77 HCC tissues and matched normal tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). TUG1 expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues and the higher expression of TUG1 was significantly correlated with tumor size and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. Moreover, silencing of TUG1 expression inhibited HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, tumorigenicity and induced apoptosis in HCC cell lines. We also found that TUG1 overexpression was induced by nuclear transcription factor SP1 and TUG1 could epigeneticly repress Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) transcription in HCC cells by binding with PRC2 and recruiting it to KLF2 promoter region.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that lncRNA TUG1, as a growth regulator, may serve as a new diagnostic biomarker and therapy target for HCC.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA profiling links subgroup classification of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas with trithorax and polycomb complex aberrations.\r\nBACKGROUND: Integrative analysis of endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) using multiple platforms has distinguished four molecular subgroups. However, the landscape of expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and their role in charting EEC subgroups and determining clinical aggressiveness remain largely unknown.RESULTS: Using stringent criteria, we identified 1,931 expressed lncRNAs and predicted potential drivers through integrative analysis. Unsupervised clustering of lncRNA expression revealed three robust categories: basal-like, luminal-like and CTNNB1-enriched subgroups. Basal-like subgroup was enriched for aggressive tumors with higher pathological grade (p &lt; 0.0001), TNM stage (p = 0.01), and somatic mutations in trithorax-group genes (MLL, MLL2 and MLL3); and it overexpressed polycomb genes EZH2 and CBX2. In contrast to the luminal-like subgroup, progesterone (PGR) and estrogen receptor (ESR1) genes were highly down-regulated in the EEC basal-like subgroup. Consistent with its enrichment for CTNNB1 mutations (69%), lncRNA profile of the CTNNB1-enriched EEC subgroup was highly similar to that of the CTNNB1-enriched liver cancer subgroup.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed integrative analysis of lncRNAs in EEC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular RNAseq profiles of 191 primary tumors for which genomic data were also available. We established lncRNA subgroup classification, correlated it with chromatin modifying gene expression, and described correlations between our lncRNA classification and clinico-genomic tumor features.CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the utility of systematic characterization of clinically annotated EEC in three clinically relevant subgroups. They also highlight the convergence of aberrations in polycomb- and trithorax-group genes in aggressive basal EEC subtypes, providing a rationale for further investigation of epigenetic therapy in this setting.'

aS'The novel long noncoding RNA AC138128.1 may be a predictive biomarker in gastric cancer.\r\nIt is well known that the differential expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays critical roles in carcinogenesis. However, the significance of lncRNA in the diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC) remains largely unknown. The goal of this study was to determine the expression level of AC138128.1, a novel lncRNA, in GC and its clinical association. The expression of AC138128.1 in 94 pairs of tumors and normal adjacent tissues (NAT) from patients with GC was detected by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The potential association between AC138128.1 expression level in GC tissue and clinicopathological features was analyzed. Finally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. The results showed that the expression level of AC138128.1 in GC was significantly decreased compared to that in NAT (p &lt; 0.001). Levels of AC138128.1 in the GC cell lines, AGS BGC-823, HG27, and SGC-7901 were lower than those in the human normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1. Moreover, the area under the ROC curve was 0.688. This study demonstrates that lncRNA AC138128.1 might be a novel biomarker for predicting GC.'

aS'The long non-coding RNA HOTAIR affects the radiosensitivity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by regulating the expression of Wnt inhibitory factor 1.\r\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is seriously resistant to radiotherapy and the mechanism is largely unknown. HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is overexpressed in PDAC. However, the function of HOTAIR has never been related to the radiosensitivity of PDAC. In this present study, the expression of HOTAIR in the PDAC cell lines and tissues was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the association between HOTAIR expression levels and X-ray treatment in PDAC cell lines was investigated. Additionally, the influence of HOTAIR knockdown on radiosensitivity, proliferation, and apoptosis of PDAC cells after radiation was evaluated by colony formation assays, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation between HOTAIR and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF-1) expression in PDAC cell lines and tissues was studied to assess the role of HOTAIR and WIF-1 in the radiosensitivity of PDAC. The results confirmed that HOTAIR expression was significantly increased in the PDAC cell lines and tissues (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8990) compared with human normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line (HPDE) and matched adjacent normal tissues (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8990). Functionally, HOTAIR knockdown enhanced the radiosensitivity of PDAC cells, reduced the proliferation, and increased the apoptosis of cells after radiation. And HOTAIR silencing increased the expression of WIF-1. Furthermore, the overexpression of WIF-1 revealed that HOTAIR modulated the radiosensitivity of PDAC cells by regulating the expression of WIF-1. These data reveals that HOTAIR can affect the radiosensitivity of PDAC cells partly via regulating the expression of WIF-1, and HOTAIR-WIF-1 axis is a potential target for PDAC radiotherapy.'

aS'A new tumor suppressor LncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 is regulated by DNMT1 and inhibits migration of glioma cells.\r\nGrowing number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new modulators in cancer origination and progression. A lncRNA, ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 9 (ADAMTS9) antisense RNA 2 (ADAMTS9-AS2), with unknown function, is the antisense transcript of tumor suppressor ADAMTS9. In the present study, we investigated the expression pattern and functional role of ADAMTS9-AS2 in glioma by using real-time PCR and gain-/loss-of-function studies. The results showed that the ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues and reversely associated with tumor grade and prognosis. Multivariate analysis of the prognosis factors showed that low ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was a significant independent predictor of poor survival in glioma. Overexpression of ADAMTS9-AS2 resulted in significant inhibition of cell migration in glioma, whereas knockdown of ADAMTS9-AS2 showed the opposite effect. We also found that ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was negatively correlated with DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). In addition, DNMT1 knockdown led to remarkable enhancement of ADAMTS9-AS2 expression. By 5-aza-dC treatment, the ADAMTS9-AS2 expression was also reactivated. The results suggested that ADAMTS9-AS2 is a novel tumor suppressor modulated by DNMT1 in glioma. LncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for glioma.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 regulates proliferation and migration in oesophageal adenocarcinoma cells.\r\nOBJECTIVES: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been shown to play important roles in the development and progression of cancer. However, functional lncRNAs and their downstream mechanisms are largely unknown in the molecular pathogenesis of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and its progression.DESIGN: lncRNAs that are abnormally upregulated in EACs were identified by RNA-sequencing analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) validation using tissues from 25 EAC patients. Cell biological assays in combination with small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown were performed in order to probe the functional relevance of these lncRNAs.RESULTS: We discovered that a lncRNA, HNF1A-AS1, is markedly upregulated in human primary EACs relative to their corresponding normal oesophageal tissues (mean fold change 10.6, p&lt;0.01). We further discovered that HNF1A-AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, suppressed S-phase entry, and inhibited cell migration and invasion in multiple in vitro EAC models (p&lt;0.05). A gene ontological analysis revealed that HNF1A-AS1 knockdown preferentially affected genes that are linked to assembly of chromatin and the nucleosome, a mechanism essential to cell cycle progression. The well known cancer-related lncRNA, H19, was the gene most markedly inhibited by HNF1A-AS1 knockdown. Consistent to this finding, there was a significant positive correlation between HNF1A-AS1 and H19 expression in primary EACs (p&lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: We have discovered abnormal upregulation of a lncRNA, HNF1A-AS1, in human EAC. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of HNF1A-AS1 participates in oesophageal tumorigenesis, and that this participation may be mediated, at least in part, by modulation of chromatin and nucleosome assembly as well as by H19 induction.'

aS'Microarray expression profile analysis of long non-coding RNAs in human gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND/AIMS: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed and have been shown to regulate key biological processes that maintain normal cellular functions. Abnormal regulation of these lncRNAs can promote tumorigenesis through resulting aberrant cellular essential functions. however, the roles of lncRNAs played in the development of gastric cardiac adenocarcinoma (GCA) remain unknown. With this work we aimed to show the expression profile of lncRNAs in GCA tissues compared with paired adjacent noncancerous tissue using microarray analysis in order to interrogate potential carcinogenesis molecular mechanisms of GCA from lncRNA level.METHODS: In this study, total RNA was isolated from 15 pairs of GCA tissue, cancerous and non-cancerous, and hybridized to arraystar lncRNA V2.0 chips containing probes representing 33,000 lncRNA genes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to validate 6 up-regulated and 6 down-regulated lncRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis including gene ontology(GO) analysis, pathway analysis and network analysis was done for further investigation.RESULTS: Pathway analysis indicated that 8 pathways corresponded to downregulated transcripts and that 20 pathways corresponded to up-regulated transcripts (p-value cut-off is 0.05). GO analysis showed that the highest enriched GOs targeted by up-regulated transcripts were tissue homeostasis and the highest esenriched GOs targeted by the downregulated transcripts were tissue homeostasis.CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to interrogate differentially expressed lncRNAs in human GCA tissues and indicates that lncRNAs may be used as novel candidate biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of GCA and potential targets for further therapy.'

LncRNAs were identified as downstream target of Notch pathway. However, the exact mechanisms involved in Notch signaling, lncRNAs and breast cancer remain to be explained.OBJECTIVE: This original research aimed to determine the prognostic implications of Notch-1 for breast cancer, and explain mechanisms involved in regulation of lnRNA GAS5 by Notch-1, and identify the function of this mechanism on breast cancer.METHOD: Thirty breast cancer patients were included from The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (China) since January 2006 in this study. The mRNA level by RT-PCR and protein level of Notch-1 by western blot in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were evaluated and 5-year survival analysis was applied to examine the significance of Notch-1. The levels of ten reported lncRNAs were determined by RT-PCR, and subsequently linear analysis was applied to analyze the relationship between these four unique lncRNAs and protein level of Notch-1, which identified the most relevant lncRNA GAS5 with Notch-1 in breast cancer. Subsequently, Notch1-siRNA was applied to influence the expression of Notch-1 in T47D, then the level of RSA5 was measured by RT-PCR, and CCK-8 assay was applied to measure the proliferation of T47D cells.RESULTS: High level of Notch-1 provided a poor prognosis in breast cancer. Interference of Notch-1 significantly suppressed proliferation of T47D cell (P &lt; 0.05), and significantly increased the level of GAS5.CONCLUSION: Notch-1 promotes breast cancer cells proliferation by regulating LncRNA GAS5.'

However, little is known about the role of HOTAIR in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, We evaluated HOTAIR expression in bone marrow of de novo AML patients, AML-CR patients and normal controls by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), then we inhibited hotair expression of two cell lines by siRNA and evaluated their proliferation by CCK, finally we analyzed its relationship with the clinicopathological parameters of AML. We found that HOTAIR is significantly upregulated in de novo AML patients compared with those of AML-CR patients and normal controls; the reduction of HOTAIR by small interfering RNA (siRNA) repressed the proliferation of HL-60 and K562; the higher expression level of HOTAIR in AML patients was significantly correlated with NCCN high risk group. In conclusion, our study indicated that hotair is highly expressed in AML patients, and hotair expression significantly correlates with clinicopathological prognostic stratification in AML.'

In this study, we described lncRNAs profiles in four pairs of human bladder cancer and matched normal bladder tissues by microarray. We finally determined 3,324 differentially expressed human lncRNAs and 2,120 differentially expressed mRNAs (\xe2\x89\xa52-fold change). A total of 110 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between the tumor and the control groups (\xe2\x89\xa58-fold change). Four lncRNAs (TNXA, CTA-134P22.2, CTC-276P9.1 and KRT19P3) were selected for further confirmation of microarray results using quantitative PCR (qPCR), and a strong correlation was identified between the qPCR results and microarray data. We also observed that numerous lncRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with the expression of tens of protein coding genes by construction of the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation showed a significant association with p53, bladder cancer, cell cycle and propanoate metabolism pathway gene expression in the bladder cancer group compared with the normal tissue group, indicating that deregulated lncRNAs may act by regulating protein-coding genes in these pathways. We demonstrated the expression profiles of human lncRNAs in bladder cancer by microarray. We identified a collection of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in bladder cancer compared with matched normal tissue. It is likely that these deregulated lncRNAs play a key or partial role in the development and/or progression of bladder cancer.'

aS'Identification of the long non-coding RNA POU3F3 in plasma as a novel biomarker for diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were present in the blood of cancer patients and have shown great potential as powerful and non-invasive tumor markers. However, little is known about the value of lncRNAs in the diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We hypothesized that ESCC-related lncRNAs might be released into the circulation during tumor initiation and could be utilized to detect and monitor ESCC.METHODS: Ten lncRNAs (HOTAIR, AFAP1-AS1, POU3F3, HNF1A-AS1, 91H, PlncRNA1, SPRY4-IT1, ENST00000435885.1, XLOC_013104 and ENST00000547963.1) which previously found to be differently expressed in esophageal cancer were selected as candidate targets for subsequent circulating lncRNA assay. A four-stage exploratory study was conducted to test the hypothesis: (1) optimization of detected method to accurately and reproducibly measure ESCC-related lncRNAs in plasma and serum; (2) evaluation of the stability of circulating lncRNAs in human plasma or serum; (3) exploration the origin of ESCC-related lncRNAs in vitro and in vivo; (4) evaluation the diagnostic power of circulating lncRNAs for ESCC.RESULTS: ESCC-related lncRNAs were detectable and stable in plasma of cancer patients, and derived largely from ESCC tumor cells. Furthermore, plasma levels of POU3F3, HNF1A-AS1 and SPRY4-IT1 were significantly higher in ESCC patients compared with normal controls. By receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, among the three lncRNAs investigated, plasma POU3F3 provided the highest diagnostic performance for detection of ESCC (the area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.842; p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001; sensitivity, 72.8%; specificity, 89.4%). Moreover, use of POU3F3 and SCCA in combination could provide a more effective diagnosis performance (AUC, 0.926, p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001, sensitivity, 85.7%; specificity, 81.4%). Most importantly, this combination was effective to detect ESCC at an early stage (80.8%).CONCLUSIONS: Plasma POU3F3 could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of ESCC, and the combination of POU3F3 and SCCA was more efficient for ESCC detection, in particular for early tumor screening.'

aS'The long intergenic noncoding RNA landscape of human lymphocytes highlights the regulation of T cell differentiation by linc-MAF-4.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs are emerging as important regulators of cellular functions, but little is known of their role in the human immune system. Here we investigated long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in 13 subsets of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes by next-generation sequencing-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq analysis) and de novo transcriptome reconstruction. We identified over 500 previously unknown lincRNAs and described lincRNA signatures. Expression of linc-MAF-4, a chromatin-associated lincRNA specific to the TH1 subset of helper T cells, was inversely correlated with expression of MAF, a TH2-associated transcription factor. Downregulation of linc-MAF-4 skewed T cell differentiation toward the TH2 phenotype. We identified a long-distance interaction between the genomic regions of the gene encoding linc-MAF-4 and MAF, where linc-MAF-4 associated with the chromatin modifiers LSD1 and EZH2; this suggested that linc-MAF-4 regulated MAF transcription through the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. Our results demonstrate a key role for lincRNA in T lymphocyte differentiation.'

aS'Regulation of the apolipoprotein gene cluster by a long noncoding RNA.\r\nApolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) is the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma. We have identified an endogenously expressed long noncoding natural antisense transcript, APOA1-AS, which acts as a negative transcriptional regulator of APOA1 both in\xc2\xa0vitro and in\xc2\xa0vivo. Inhibition of APOA1-AS in cultured cells resulted in the increased expression of APOA1 and two neighboring genes in the APO cluster. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses of a \xe2\x88\xbc50 kb chromatin region flanking the APOA1 gene demonstrated that APOA1-AS can modulate distinct histone methylation patterns that mark active and/or inactive gene expression through the recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes. Targeting APOA1-AS with short antisense oligonucleotides also enhanced APOA1 expression in both human and monkey liver cells and induced an increase in hepatic RNA and protein expression in African green monkeys. Furthermore, the results presented here highlight the significant local modulatory effects of long noncoding antisense RNAs and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of manipulating the expression of these transcripts both in\xc2\xa0vitro and in\xc2\xa0vivo.'

aS'RMEL3, a novel BRAFV600E-associated long noncoding RNA, is required for MAPK and PI3K signaling in melanoma.\r\nPrevious work identified RMEL3 as a lncRNA with enriched expression in melanoma. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data confirmed RMEL3 enriched expression in melanoma and demonstrated its association with the presence of BRAFV600E. RMEL3 siRNA-mediated silencing markedly reduced (95%) colony formation in different BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines. Multiple genes of the MAPK and PI3K pathways found to be correlated with RMEL3 in TCGA samples were experimentally confirmed. RMEL3 knockdown led to downregulation of activators or effectors of these pathways, including FGF2, FGF3, DUSP6, ITGB3 and GNG2. RMEL3 knockdown induces gain of protein levels of tumor suppressor PTEN and the G1/S cyclin-Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, as well as a decrease of pAKT (T308), BRAF, pRB (S807, S811) and cyclin B1. Consistently, knockdown resulted in an accumulation of cells in G1 phase and subG0/G1 in an asynchronously growing population. Thus, TCGA data and functional experiments demonstrate that RMEL3 is required for MAPK and PI3K signaling, and its knockdown decrease BRAFV600E melanoma cell survival and proliferation.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA UCA1 contributes to the progression of prostate cancer and regulates proliferation through KLF4-KRT6/13 signaling pathway.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) UCA1 have been shown to paly an important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and UCA1 dysfunction is related to TNM stage, metastasis and postoperative survival in several cancers. However, the biological role and clinical significance of UCA1 in the carcinogenesis of prostate cancer (PC) remain largely unclear. Herein, we found that UCA1 was abnormally upregulated in tumor tissues from PC patients, and patients with high UCA1 levels had a significantly poorer prognosis. Intriguingly, the mRNA and protein levels of KLF4 were significantly increased in tumor tissues, which was highly correlated to UCA1 levels. Moreover, UCA1 depletion inhibited the growth and induced apoptosis in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. In addition, UCA1 loss-of-function could decrease KLF4 expression, subsequently, the downregulation of KRT6 and KRT13. Taken together, our study indicated that UCA1 had a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of PC. Moreover, UCA1 loss-of-function inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis, at least partially, through inactivation KLF4-KRT6/13 cascade.'

aS'Aberrant NEAT1 expression is associated with clinical outcome in high grade glioma patients.\r\nLong noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 has been reported to play critical roles in various human tumor entities and related to the survival of patients with malignancies. However, little is known about the role of lncRNA NEAT1 in glioma patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of NEAT1 in human glioma and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis in human glioma; we analyzed the relationship of lncRNA NEAT1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in glioma patients. In our results, the relative level of NEAT1 expression was higher in cancer tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues (p &lt; 0.001). High NEAT1 expression was observed to be closely correlated with larger tumor size (p = 0.023), higher WHO grade (p = 0.005), and recurrence (p = 0.011). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high NEAT1 expression showed unfavorable overall survival (OS) than the low NEAT1 expression group (p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis results revealed that NEAT1 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for OS in addition to postoperative chemoradiotherapy and WHO grade. Moreover, high NEAT1 expression in patients with stage III~IV disease and postoperative chemoradiotherapy conferred unfavorable OS (stage III~IV p = 0.002, postoperative chemoradiotherapy p = 0.000). This study supports NEAT1 as a potential prognostic predictor with its high expression in cancer tissues and its association with carcinogenesis and progression in glioma.'

aS'Transcriptome profiling of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma reveals a long noncoding RNA acting as a tumor suppressor.\r\nEsophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) is among the most common malignant cancers worldwide. In the past, extensive efforts have been made to characterize the involvement of protein-coding genes in ESCC tumorigenesis but few for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). To investigate the transcriptome profile and functional relevance of lncRNAs, we performed an integrative analysis of a customized combined lncRNA-mRNA microarray and RNA-seq data on ESCCs and matched normal tissues. We identified numerous lncRNAs that were differentially expressed between the normal and tumor tissues, termed "ESCC-associated lncRNAs (ESCALs)", of which, the majority displayed restricted expression pattern. Also, a subset of ESCALs appeared to be associated with ESCC patient survival. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further suggested that over half of the ESCALs were positively-or negatively-associated with metastasis. Among these, we identified a novel nuclear-retained lncRNA, named Epist, which is generally highly expressed in esophagus, and which is down-regulated during ESCC progression. Epist over-expression and knockdown studies further suggest that Epist inhibits the metastasis, acting as a tumor suppressor in ESCC. Collectively, our analysis of the ESCC transcriptome identified the potential tumor suppressing lncRNA Epist, and provided a foundation for future efforts to identify functional lncRNAs for cancerous therapeutic targeting.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA LINC01207 promotes proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma.\r\nLung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and lung squamous cell cancer (LSCC) are two most common histological types of lung cancer, while they differ in many aspects. Recent evidence shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the process of cancer initiation and progression. Thus, characterization of LAD and LSCC associated lncRNAs may help understand the difference between LAD and LSCC. Here, we analyzed three sets of RNA-seq data, including LAD RNA-seq data from TCGA project. We identified a novel lncRNA, long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1207 (LINC01207) which was significantly up-regulated in LAD tissues compared with paired non-tumor tissues (5.78 fold increase, P&lt;0.05), while there was no significant differences between LSCC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues. The expression level of LINC01207 was associated with TNM stage of LAD patients, and higher LINC01207 level indicated advanced TNM stage (P&lt;0.05) and shorter survival (HR=2.53, P&lt;0.05). By small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated knockdown of LINC01207, we determined the biological function of LINC01207 in A549 cell line. After knockdown of LINC01207, cell proliferation ability was inhibited. Further analysis showed that after silence of LINC01207, the percentage of apoptotic cells significantly increased. By RNA immunoprecipitation and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that LINC01207 could bind with EZH2 and mediated trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 at the promoter region of Bad, an important pro-apoptotic gene. Finally, we developed xenograft tumor models in nude mice and xenograft tumors derived from A549 cells transfected with siRNA-LINC01207 had significantly lower tumor weight and smaller tumor volume. In summary, the novel lncRNA, LINC01207 is specifically up-regulated in LAD but not in LSCC; and LINC01207 could promote LAD cell growth both in vivo and in vitro.'

aS"Long noncoding RNA ANRIL promotes non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis by silencing KLF2 and P21 expression.\r\nRecent evidence highlights long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) as crucial regulators of cancer biology that contribute to essential cancer cell functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), several lncRNAs' expressions are misregulated and have been nominated as critical actors in NSCLC tumorigenesis. LncRNA ANRIL was first found to be required for the PRC2 recruitment to and silencing of p15(INK4B), the expression of which is induced by the ATM-E2F1 signaling pathway. Our previous study showed that ANRIL was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer, and it could promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis by silencing of miR99a and miR449a transcription. However, its clinical significance and potential role in NSCLC is still not documented. In this study, we reported that ANRIL expression was increased in NSCLC tissues, and its expression level was significantly correlated with tumor-node-metastasis stages and tumor size. Moreover, patients with high levels of ANRIL expression had a relatively poor prognosis. In addition, taking advantage of loss-of-function experiments in NSCLC cells, we found that knockdown of ANRIL expression could impair cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis both in vitro and vivo. Furthermore, we uncover that ANRIL could not repress p15 expression in PC9 cells, but through silencing of KLF2 and P21 transcription. Thus, we conclusively demonstrate that lncRNA ANRIL plays a key role in NSCLC development by associating its expression with survival in patients with NSCLC, providing novel insights on the function of lncRNA-driven tumorigenesis."

aS'Tissue-specific RNA-Seq in human evoked inflammation identifies blood and adipose LincRNA signatures of cardiometabolic diseases.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Inappropriate transcriptional activation of innate immunity is a pathological feature of several cardiometabolic disorders, but little is known about inflammatory modulation of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in disease-relevant human tissues.APPROACH AND RESULTS: We applied deep RNA sequencing (&gt;500 million filtered reads per sample) to blood and adipose during low-dose experimental endotoxemia (lipopolysaccharide) in a healthy human, with targeted replication in separate individuals undergoing endotoxemia (n=6), to identify inflammatory lincRNAs. A subset of these lincRNAs was examined for expression in adipocytes and monocytes, modulation in adipose of obese humans, and overlap with genome-wide association study signals for inflammatory and cardiometabolic traits. Of a stringent set of 4284 lincRNAs, \xe2\x89\x8811% to 22% were expressed with 201 and 56 lincRNAs modulated by lipopolysaccharide in blood or adipose, respectively. Tissue-specific expression of a subset of 6 lipopolysaccharide-lincRNAs was replicated with lipopolysaccharide modulation confirmed for all 3 expressed in blood and 2 of 4 expressed in adipose. The broader generalizability of findings in blood of subject A was confirmed by RNA sequencing in 7 additional subjects. We confirmed adipocytes and monocytes as potential cell-sources of selective lipopolysaccharide-regulated lincRNAs, and 2 of these, linc-DMRT2 (P=0.002) and linc-TP53I13 (P=0.01), were suppressed in adipose of obese humans. Finally, we provide examples of lipopolysaccharide-modulated lincRNAs that overlap single nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with cardiometabolic traits.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into tissue-level, inflammatory transcriptome regulation in cardiometabolic diseases. These are complementary to more usual approaches limited to interrogation of DNA variations.'

aS'TET3 mediates the activation of human hepatic stellate cells via modulating the expression of long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1.\r\nActivated Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in liver fibrosis and a lot of efforts have been made to dissect the underlying mechanism involved in activation of HSCs. However, the underlying mechanism remains douteux up to now. In the present study, we found that TET3, one member of ten-eleven translocation (TET) protein family, reduced significantly in HSCs LX-2 activated by TGF-\xce\xb21. To study the function of TET3 in activation of HSCs, knockdown was performed by RNA interference. Results showed that cell proliferation rise significantly and cell apoptosis reduce obviously after knockdown of TET3. Meanwhile, IHC showed that the expression of \xce\xb1-SMA rise significantly compared to control. These results indicated that TET3 is closely associated with the activation of HSCs. Further studies found that long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1 was reduced significantly in LX-2 cell after treatment with siRNA for TET3. The result hinted that TET3 activate HSCs through modulating the expression of HIF1A-AS1. To confirm this hypothesis, RNA interference was performed to silence the HIF1A-AS1. Results showed that HIF1A-AS1 silencing lead to enhancing in cell proliferation and declining apoptosis. Taken together, TET3 can mediate the activation of HSCs via modulating the expression of the long non-coding RNA HIF1A-AS1.'

aS"Downregulation of a long noncoding RNA-ncRuPAR contributes to tumor inhibition in colorectal cancer.\r\nIn recent years, the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancer is increasingly focused. ncRuPAR is a newly detected lncRNA; in previous study, we found out that ncRuPAR could inhibit tumor progression by downregulating protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), but its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is never elucidated. Here, we conducted a self-control study which includes 105 CRC samples. By quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining, we detected the expression of ncRuPAR and PAR-1 as well as their correlation; we further associated these data with the clinicopathologic parameters. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of ncRuPAR and PAR-1, respectively. Our results indicated that the expression of ncRuPAR was significantly downregulated in CRC compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues, but the level of PAR-1 mRNA in cancerous tissues was significantly higher than in adjacent normal areas. The expression of ncRuPAR was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, Duck's stage, differentiation, and TNM stage and was potentially negatively associated with the mRNA levels and EI scores of PAR-1. The area under the ROC curve of ncRuPAR was 0.81 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75-0.87); at a cutoff value of 8.34, the ncRuPAR measurement had a sensitivity of 97.14%, a specificity of 65.87%, and an accuracy of 82.86% to predict CRC."

aS'Study on expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and repulsive guidance molecule b in non-small cell lung cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: The relationships between lncRNAs and tumors have currently become one of the focuses on cancer studies. However, there are a few studies about lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at present.METHODS: Microarray analysis was designed to study the expression patterns of lncRNAs in three pairs of NSCLC tissues. The expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and repulsive guidance molecule b (RGMB) were detected in 72 paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR assay. The relations of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and RGMB expression with clinicopathological factors of NSCLC patients were explored. A549 and SPC-A-1 cells were transfected with siRNA of lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and negative control. RGMB expression level was detected by qRT-PCR assay and western blot analysis.RESULTS: The results of microarray found that 571 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in NSCLC tissues (Fold change cut-off: 5.0, P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05), including 304 upregulated and 267 downregulated lncRNAs. The results of qRT-PCR showed that lncRNA RGMB-AS1 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05), while RGMB mRNA showed an opposite trend (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of lncRNA RGMB-AS1and RGMB mRNA were inversely correlated (R(2)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.590, P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). While lncRNA RGMB-AS1 and RGMB expression levels in NSCLC tissues were associated with the occurrence of differentiation status, lymph node metastases and TNM stage (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). Transfection with siRNA of lncRNA RGMB-AS1, subsequent results showed that RGMB mRNA and protein expression were upregulated (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05) in A549 and SPC-A-1 cells compared to the control groups.CONCLUSION: We identified lncRNA RGMB-AS1 was upregulated and RGMB was downregulated in NSCLC patients. Both were related to differentiation status, lymph node metastases and TNM stage. Studies also indicated that lncRNA RGMB-AS1and RGMB were inversely correlated.VIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/7911587521528276.'

aS'High expression of CAI2, a 9p21-embedded long noncoding RNA, contributes to advanced-stage neuroblastoma.\r\nNeuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer with significant genomic and biologic heterogeneity. p16 and ARF, two important tumor-suppressor genes on chromosome 9p21, are inactivated commonly in most cancers, but paradoxically overexpressed in neuroblastoma. Here, we report that exon \xce\xb3 in p16 is also part of an undescribed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that we have termed CAI2 (CDKN2A/ARF Intron 2 lncRNA). CAI2 is a single-exon gene with a poly A signal located in but independent of the p16/ARF exon 3. CAI2 is expressed at very low levels in normal tissue, but is highly expressed in most tumor cell lines with an intact 9p21 locus. Concordant expression of CAI2 with p16 and ARF in normal tissue along with the ability of CAI2 to induce p16 expression suggested that CAI2 may regulate p16 and/or ARF. In neuroblastoma cells transformed by serial passage in vitro, leading to more rapid proliferation, CAI2, p16, and ARF expression all increased dramatically. A similar relationship was also observed in primary neuroblastomas where CAI2 expression was significantly higher in advanced-stage neuroblastoma, independently of MYCN amplification. Consistent with its association with high-risk disease, CAI2 expression was also significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes, although this effect was reduced when adjusted for MYCN amplification. Taken together, our findings suggested that CAI2 contributes to the paradoxical overexpression of p16 in neuroblastoma, where CAI2 may offer a useful biomarker of high-risk disease.'

aS"Role of non-coding RNAs in maintaining primary airway smooth muscle cells.\r\nBACKGROUND: The airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell maintains its own proliferative rate and contributes to the inflammatory response in the airways, effects that are inhibited by corticosteroids, used in the treatment of airways diseases.OBJECTIVE: We determined the differential expression of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNA species (lncRNAs) in primary ASM cells following treatment with a corticosteroid, dexamethasone, and fetal calf serum (FCS).METHODS: mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA expression was measured by microarray and quantitative real-time PCR.RESULTS: A small number of miRNAs (including miR-150, -371-5p, -718, -940, -1181, -1207-5p, -1915, and -3663-3p) were decreased following exposure to dexamethasone and FCS. The mRNA targets of these miRNAs were increased in expression. The changes in mRNA expression were associated with regulation of ASM actin cytoskeleton. We also observed changes in expression of lncRNAs, including natural antisense, pseudogenes, intronic lncRNAs, and intergenic lncRNAs following dexamethasone and FCS. We confirmed the change in expression of three of these, LINC00882, LINC00883, PVT1, and its transcriptional activator, c-MYC. We propose that four of these lincRNAs (RP11-46A10.4, LINC00883, BCYRN1, and LINC00882) act as miRNA 'sponges' for 4 miRNAs (miR-150, -371-5p, -940, -1207-5p).CONCLUSION: This in-vitro model of primary ASM cell phenotype was associated with the regulation of several ncRNAs. Their identification allows for in-vitro functional experimentation to establish causality with the primary ASM phenotype, and in airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)."

aS"The long non-coding RNA ERIC is regulated by E2F and modulates the cellular response to DNA damage.\r\nBACKGROUND: The human genome encodes thousands of unique long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and these transcripts are emerging as critical regulators of gene expression and cell fate. However, the transcriptional regulation of their expression is not fully understood. The pivotal transcription factor E2F1 which can induce both proliferation and cell death, is a critical downstream target of the tumor suppressor, RB. The retinoblastoma pathway is often inactivated in human tumors resulting in deregulated E2F activity.RESULTS: Here, we report that lncRNA XLOC 006942, which we named ERIC, is regulated by E2F1 and, most probably, also E2F3. We show that expression levels of ERIC were elevated upon activation of exogenous E2F1, E2F3 or endogenous E2Fs. Moreover, knockdown of either E2F1 or E2F3 reduced ERIC levels and endogenous E2F1 binds ERIC's promoter. Expression of ERIC was cell cycle regulated and peaked in G1 in an E2F1-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERIC expression increased E2F1-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that E2F1 and ERIC constitute a negative feedback loop that modulates E2F1 activity. Furthermore, ERIC levels were increased following DNA damage by the chemotherapeutic drug Etoposide, and inhibition of ERIC expression enhanced Etoposide -induced apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: Our data identify ERIC as a novel lncRNA that is transcriptionally regulated by E2Fs, and restricts apoptosis induced by E2F1, as well as by DNA damage."

aS'Association of large intergenic noncoding RNA expression with disease activity and organ damage in systemic lupus erythematosus.\r\nINTRODUCTION: Despite growing evidence that large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) can regulate gene expression and widely take part in normal physiological and disease conditions, our knowledge of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-related lincRNAs remains limited. The aim of this study was to detect the levels of four lincRNAs (ENST00000500949: linc0949, ENST00000500597: linc0597, ENST00000501992: linc1992, and ENST00000523995: linc3995) involved in innate immunity in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with SLE and correlate these lincRNA levels with disease activity, organ damage, clinical features and medical therapies.METHODS: PBMCs were obtained from 102 patients with SLE, 54 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 76 healthy donors. lincRNA expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) scores, and organ damage was evaluated with the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index.RESULTS: linc0949 and linc0597 were significantly decreased in patients with SLE compared with patients with RA and healthy control subjects. linc0949 was correlated with SLEDAI-2K score (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89-0.329, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0007), as well as with complement component C3 level (r\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.348, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.0003). The level of linc0949 was also reduced in patients with SLE who had the presence of cumulative organ damage. In addition, decreasing expression of linc0949 was associated with lupus nephritis. linc0949 expression significantly increased after treatment, whereas neither disease activity nor organ damage correlated with linc0597 expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide novel empirical evidence that linc0949 could be a potential biomarker for diagnosis, disease activity and therapeutic response in SLE.'

aS'Knockdown of a novel lincRNA AATBC suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in bladder cancer.\r\nLong intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) play important roles in regulating various biological processes in cancer, including proliferation and apoptosis. However, the roles of lincRNAs in bladder cancer remain elusive. In this study, we identified a novel lincRNA, which we termed AATBC. We found that AATBC was overexpressed in bladder cancer patient tissues and positively correlated with tumor grade and pT stage. We also found that inhibition of AATBC resulted in cell proliferation arrest through G1 cell cycle mediated by cyclin D1, CDK4, p18 and phosphorylated Rb. In addition, inhibition of AATBC induced cell apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway, as evidenced by the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. The investigation for the signaling pathway revealed that the apoptosis following AATBC knockdown was mediated by activation of phosphorylated JNK and suppression of NRF2. Furthermore, JNK inhibitor SP600125 could attenuate the apoptotic effect achieved by AATBC knockdown, confirming the involvement of JNK signaling in the induced apoptosis. Moreover, mouse xenograft model revealed that knockdown of AATBC led to suppress tumorigenesis in vivo. Taken together, our study indicated that AATBC might play a critical role in pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis in bladder cancer by regulating cell cycle, intrinsic apoptosis signaling, JNK signaling and NRF2.

aS"Identification and initial functional characterization of a human vascular cell-enriched long noncoding RNA.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a rapidly growing class of RNA genes with functions related primarily to transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of gene expression. There is a paucity of information about lncRNA expression and function in human vascular cells. Thus, we set out to identify novel lncRNA genes in human vascular smooth muscle cells and to gain insight into their role in the control of smooth muscle cell phenotypes.APPROACH AND RESULTS: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells revealed 31 unannotated lncRNAs, including a vascular cell-enriched lncRNA (Smooth muscle and Endothelial cell-enriched migration/differentiation-associated long NonCoding RNA [SENCR]). Strand-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends indicate that SENCR is transcribed antisense from the 5' end of the FLI1 gene and exists as 2 splice variants. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and biochemical fractionation studies demonstrate SENCR is a cytoplasmic lncRNA. Consistent with this observation, knockdown studies reveal little to no cis-acting effect of SENCR on FLI1 or neighboring gene expression. RNA-seq experiments in smooth muscle cells after SENCR knockdown disclose decreased expression of Myocardin and numerous smooth muscle contractile genes, whereas several promigratory genes are increased. Reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting experiments validate several differentially expressed genes after SENCR knockdown. Loss-of-function studies in scratch wound and Boyden chamber assays support SENCR as an inhibitor of smooth muscle cell migration.CONCLUSIONS: SENCR is a new vascular cell-enriched, cytoplasmic lncRNA that seems to stabilize the smooth muscle cell contractile phenotype."

aS'Long non-coding RNA Loc554202 induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells via the caspase cleavage cascades.\r\nBACKGROUND: Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has frequently been reported in cancer studies, including those of colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that lncRNAs are significantly correlated with the pathogenesis, development and metastasis of cancer. Loc554202 is a 2166-bp transcript on human chromosome 9p21.3, the expression of which is dysregulated in breast and lung cancer cells. However, its role in CRC remains under investigation.METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out to assess the relative expression of Loc554202 in CRC cell lines and tissues. Gain and/or loss of function approaches were used to investigate the potential functional roles in cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. qRT-PCR, western-blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of apoptosis-related factors.RESULTS: Loc554202 was significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues and CRC cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue and a normal human intestinal epithelial cell line. Low Loc554202 expression was closely associated with advanced pathologic stage and a larger tumor size. The overexpression of Loc554202 decreased the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro and hindered tumorigenesis in vivo. Loc554202 regulated cell apoptosis partly through the activation of specific caspase cleavage cascades.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Loc554202 may play an important role in the progression of CRC and could be a candidate prognostic biomarker or a target for new cancer therapies.'

aS'Over-expression of lncRNA DANCR is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.\r\nDespite advances made in the diagnosis and treatment of human colorectal cancer (CRC), the long-term survival for CRC remains poor. Long non-coding RNA anti-differentiation ncRNA (lncRNA DANCR) was identified to be involved in carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. While its expression in CRC and potential role in tumor progression is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the expression level of lncRNA DANCR as well as its association with CRC progression and prognosis. The expression of lncRNA DANCR was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 104 CRC specimens. The prognostic value of lncRNA DANCR was further analysis. Our results showed that lncRNA DANCR expression was increased in CRC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues (P&lt;0.05). In addition, tumors with high lncRNA DANCR expression was correlated with TNM stage, histologic grade, and lymph node metastasis (P&lt;0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high lncRNA DANCR expression had a shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with the low lncRNA DANCR expression group (P&lt;0.05). Moreover, in a multivariate Cox model, our results showed that lncRNA DANCR expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for both OS and DFS in CRC. Our data indicated that lncRNA DANCR expression might be a novel potential biomarker for CRC prognosis.'

aS'PU.1-Regulated Long Noncoding RNA lnc-MC Controls Human Monocyte/Macrophage Differentiation through Interaction with MicroRNA 199a-5p.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in mammalian development, but little is known about their roles in monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Here we identified a long noncoding monocytic RNA (lnc-MC) that exhibits increased expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1 and HL-60 cells as well as CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is transcriptionally activated by PU.1. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrate that lnc-MC promotes monocyte/macrophage differentiation of THP-1 cells and CD34(+) HSPCs. Mechanistic investigation reveals that lnc-MC acts as a competing endogenous RNA to sequester microRNA 199a-5p (miR-199a-5p) and alleviate repression on the expression of activin A receptor type 1B (ACVR1B), an important regulator of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. We also noted a repressive effect of miR-199a-5p on lnc-MC expression and function, but PU.1-dominant downregulation of miR-199a-5p weakens the role of miR-199a-5p in the reciprocal regulation between miR-199a-5p and lnc-MC. Altogether, our work demonstrates that two PU.1-regulated noncoding RNAs, lnc-MC and miR-199a-5p, have opposing roles in monocyte/macrophage differentiation and that lnc-MC facilitates the differentiation process, enhancing the effect of PU.1, by soaking up miR-199a-5p and releasing ACVR1B expression. Thus, we reveal a novel regulatory mechanism, comprising PU.1, lnc-MC, miR-199a-5p, and ACVR1B, in monocyte/macrophage differentiation.'

aS'Decreased expression of the long non-coding RNA FENDRR is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer and FENDRR regulates gastric cancer cell metastasis by affecting fibronectin1 expression.\r\nBACKGROUND: FENDRR is a long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) that binds to polycomb repressive complexe 2 (PRC2) to epigenetically regulate the expression of its target gene. The clinical role of FENDRR in carcinomas remains yet to be found.METHOD: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine FENDRR expression in gastric cancer cell lines/tissues compared with normal epithelial cells/adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Cell proliferation assays, Wound healing assays, and in vitro and in vivo invasion and migration assays were performed to detect the biological effects of FENDRR in gastric cancer cells. Real-time PCR, western-blot and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of fibronectin1 (FN1). Secreted matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities were detected and characterized using gelatin zymography assay.RESULTS: FENDRR was downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines and cancerous tissues, as compared with normal gastric epithelial cells and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples. Low FENDRR expression was correlated with deeper tumor invasion (p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), higher tumor stage (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.001), and lymphatic metastasis (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.007). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that low FENDRR expression predicted poor prognosis. Histone deacetylation was involved in the downregulation of FENDRR in gastric cancer cells. FENDER overexpression suppressed invasion and migration by gastric cancer cells in vitro, by downregulating FN1 and MMP2/MMP9 expression.CONCLUSION: Low expression of the lncRNA FENDRR occurs in gastric cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, FENDRR plays an important role in the progression and metastasis of gastric cancer.'

aS'CAHM, a long non-coding RNA gene hypermethylated in colorectal neoplasia.\r\nThe CAHM gene (Colorectal Adenocarcinoma HyperMethylated), previously LOC100526820, is located on chromosome 6, hg19 chr6:163\xe2\x80\x89834\xe2\x80\x89097-163\xe2\x80\x89834\xe2\x80\x89982. It lacks introns, encodes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and is located adjacent to the gene QKI, which encodes an RNA binding protein. Deep bisulphite sequencing of ten colorectal cancer (CRC) and matched normal tissues demonstrated frequent hypermethylation within the CAHM gene in cancer. A quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) was used to characterize additional tissue samples. With a threshold of 5% methylation, the CAHM assay was positive in 2/26 normal colorectal tissues (8%), 17/21 adenomas (81%), and 56/79 CRC samples (71%). A reverse transcriptase-qPCR assay showed that CAHM RNA levels correlated negatively with CAHM % methylation, and therefore CAHM gene expression is typically decreased in CRC. The CAHM qMSP assay was applied to DNA isolated from plasma specimens from 220 colonoscopy-examined patients. Using a threshold of 3 pg methylated genomic DNA per mL plasma, methylated CAHM sequences were detected in the plasma DNA of 40/73 (55%) of CRC patients compared with 3/73 (4%) from subjects with adenomas and 5/74 (7%) from subjects without neoplasia. Both the frequency of detection and the amount of methylated CAHM DNA released into plasma increased with increasing cancer stage. Methylated CAHM DNA shows promise as a plasma biomarker for use in screening for CRC.'

aS'Transcriptome Analysis of Long Noncoding RNAs in Toll-Like Receptor 3-Activated Mesenchymal Stem Cells.\r\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess great immunomodulatory capacity which lays the foundation for their therapeutic effects in a variety of diseases. Recently, toll-like receptors (TLR) have been shown to modulate MSC functions; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of regulators involved in a wide range of biological processes. To explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in TLR stimulated MSCs, we performed a comprehensive lncRNA and mRNA profiling through microarray. 10.2% of lncRNAs (1733 out of 16967) and 15.1% of mRNA transcripts (1760 out of 11632) were significantly differentially expressed (absolute fold-change \xe2\x89\xa55 , P value \xe2\x89\xa40.05) in TLR3 stimulated MSCs. Furthermore, we characterized the differentially expressed lncRNAs through their classes and length distribution and correlated them with differentially expressed mRNA. Here, we are the first to determine genome-wide lncRNAs expression patterns in TLR3 stimulated MSCs by microarray and this work could provide a comprehensive framework of the transcriptome landscapes of TLR3 stimulated MSCs.'

aS'The lncRNA NRON modulates HIV-1 replication in a NFAT-dependent manner and is differentially regulated by early and late viral proteins.\r\nA majority of the human genome is transcribed into noncoding RNAs, of which the functions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are poorly understood. Many host proteins and RNAs have been characterized for their roles in HIV/AIDS pathogenesis, but there is only one lncRNA, NEAT1, which is shown to affect the HIV-1 life cycle. We profiled 90 disease-related lncRNAs and found NRON (noncoding repressor of Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells [NFAT]) to be one of several lncRNAs whose expression was significantly altered following HIV-1 infection. The regulation of NRON expression during the HIV-1 life cycle was complex; its levels were reduced by the early viral accessory protein Nef and increased by the late protein Vpu. Consequently, Nef and Vpu also modulated activity of the transcription factor NFAT. The knockdown of NRON enhanced HIV-1 replication through increased activity of NFAT and the viral LTR. Using siRNA-mediated NFAT knockdown, we show the effects of NRON on HIV-1 replication to be mediated by NFAT, and the viral Nef and Vpu proteins to modulate NFAT activity through their effects on NRON. These findings add the lncRNA, NRON to the vast repertoire of host factors utilized by HIV for infection and persistence.'

aS'The role of MALAT1/miR-1/slug axis on radioresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r\nRecent studies demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have a critical role in the regulation of cancer progression and metastasis. However, little is known whether lncRNA regulated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell radioresistance. In the present study, we found that MALAT1 was significantly upregulated in NPC cell lines and tissues. Knockdown of MALAT1 could sensitize NPC cells to radiation both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we found that MALAT1 regulated radioresistance by modulating cancer stem cell (CSC) activity. Furthermore, we found that there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-1, and slug was identified as a downstream target of miR-1. Taking these observations into consideration, we proposed that MALAT1 regulated CSC activity and radioresistance by modulating miR-1/slug axis, which indicated that MALAT1 could act as a therapeutic target for NPC patients.'

aS"Up-regulation of long non-coding RNA Sox2ot promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell metastasis and correlates with poor prognosis.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and the lncRNA Sox2ot is up-regulated in some tumors. However, the contributions of Sox2ot to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown.METHODS: In the present study, expression of lncRNA Sox2ot was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues in 84 HCC patients. The association of lncRNA Sox2ot expression with clinicopathological features and the prognosis of HCC patients were also analyzed. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazards model. Small interfering RNA assay was used to explore the function of lncRNA Sox2ot on HCC cell migration and invasion.RESULTS: lncRNA Sox2ot expression level was significantly higher in HCC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (P&lt;0.05). High expression of lncRNA Sox2ot was associated with histological grade, TNM stage, and vein invasion. The 5-year overall survival of high lncRNA Sox2ot expression group was significantly shorter than that of low lncRNA Sox2ot expression group (P&lt;0.05). The multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that lncRNA Sox2ot expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. In addition, the metastasis ability of HCC cells was significantly decreased by knocking down lncRNA Sox2ot expression.CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that lncRNA Sox2ot played crucial roles in promoting HCC cell migration and invasion, and might represent a novel prognostic biomarker for HCC."

aS'Extracellular vesicle-mediated transfer of long non-coding RNA ROR modulates chemosensitivity in human hepatocellular cancer.\r\nHepatocellular cancers (HCC) are highly resistant to chemotherapy. TGF\xce\xb2 has been associated with chemoresistance in some human cancers but the mechanisms involved are unknown. We explored how TGF\xce\xb2 might contribute to altered responses to therapy by assessing the involvement and mechanistic contribution of extracellular vesicle long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in mediating TGF\xce\xb2-dependent chemoresistance. TGF\xce\xb2 reduced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib or doxorubicin and altered the release of both extracellular vesicles and of selected lncRNA within these vesicles. Amongst these, lincRNA-ROR (linc-ROR), a stress-responsive lncRNA was highly expressed in HCC cells and enriched within extracellular vesicles derived from tumor cells. Incubation with HCC-derived extracellular vesicles increased linc-ROR expression and reduced chemotherapy-induced cell death in recipient cells. Sorafenib increased linc-ROR expression in both tumor cells and extracellular vesicles, whereas siRNA to linc-ROR increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Tumor-initiating cells that express CD133 have an increased resistance to therapy. TGF\xce\xb2 increased expression of CD133+ cells and colony growth in limiting dilution assays, both of which were attenuated by linc-ROR knockdown. These data provide mechanistic insights into primary chemoresistance in HCC by showing that: (a) TGF\xce\xb2 selectively enriches linc-RoR within extracellular vesicles, which has a potential role in intercellular signaling in response to TGF\xce\xb2; (b) expression and enrichment of linc-ROR during chemotherapeutic stress plays a functional role in chemoresistance; and (c) the effects of TGF\xce\xb2 on chemoresistance in HCC may involve linc-RoR-dependent effects on tumor-initiating cells. These findings implicate extracellular vesicle lncRNA as mediators of the chemotherapeutic response, and support targeting linc-ROR to enhance chemosensitivity in HCC.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA ZFAS1 interacts with CDK1 and is involved in p53-dependent cell cycle control and apoptosis in colorectal cancer.\r\nWe determined expression of 83 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identified ZFAS1 to be significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. In cohort of 119 CRC patients we observed that 111 cases displayed at least two-times higher expression of ZFAS1 in CRC compared to paired normal colorectal tissue (P &lt; 0.0001). By use of CRC cell lines (HCT116+/+, HCT116-/- and DLD-1) we showed, that ZFAS1 silencing decreases proliferation through G1-arrest of cell cycle, and also tumorigenicity of CRC cells. We identified Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as interacting partner of ZFAS1 by pull-down experiment and RNA immunoprecipitation. Further, we have predicted by bioinformatics approach ZFAS1 to sponge miR-590-3p, which was proved to target CDK1. Levels of CDK1 were not affected by ZFAS1 silencing, but cyclin B1 was decreased in both cell lines. We observed significant increase in p53 levels and PARP cleavage in CRC cell lines after ZFAS1 silencing indicating increase in apoptosis. Our data suggest that ZFAS1 may function as oncogene in CRC by two main actions: (i) via destabilization of p53 and through (ii) interaction with CDK1/cyclin B1 complex leading to cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. However, molecular mechanisms behind these interactions have to be further clarified.'

aS'Decreased expression of long non-coding RNA GAS5 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes cell proliferation and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating vimentin.\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key in carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lncRNA GAS5 in HCC tissues and to define the role of growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) in the regulation of hepatoma cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were performed to investigate the expression of GAS5 in tumor tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues from 50 patients with HCC. Low expression of GAS5 was significantly correlated with differentiation (P&lt;0.010) and portal vein tumor thrombosis (P=0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that GAS5 expression was an independent predictor for overall survival (P=0.017). Further experiments demonstrated that overexpression of GAS5 significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro. Overexpression of GAS5 significantly promoted the apoptosis of hepatoma cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that GAS5 negatively regulates vimentin expression in vitro and in vivo. Notably, vimentin knockdown promoted GAS5-pcDNA3.1-inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation. In conclusion, the present study suggests an important role of GAS5 in the molecular etiology of HCC and suggests the potential application of GAS5 in HCC therapy.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA PVT1 as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer.\r\nAccumulating evidence has indicated that long non-coding RNA PVT1 is upregulated in various human cancers. However, it remains unclear whether PVT1 is involved in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study was designed to investigate the expression, biological role, and clinical significance of PVT1 in NSCLC. Our results indicated that PVT1 expression was significantly increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and its upregulation was associated with advanced T-stage and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and regional lymph node metastasis. PVT1 expression levels were robust in differentiating NSCLC tissues from controls. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression analysis showed that high expression of PVT1 was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in NSCLC patients. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and colony formation assays indicated that knockdown of PVT1 remarkably inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, whereas overexpression of PVT1 significantly promoted cellular proliferation. In addition, PVT1 knockdown increased the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase and reduced the number of cells in the S phase, while overexpression of PVT1 could promote cell cycle progression. Furthermore, our findings also revealed that the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of P15 and P21 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cells transfected with PVT1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and downregulated in cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-PVT1. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PVT1 might serve as a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC, and it could promote the proliferation of NSCLC cells by downregulating p15 and p21 expression.'

aS'Identification of mRNAs and lincRNAs associated with lung cancer progression using next-generation RNA sequencing from laser micro-dissected archival FFPE tissue specimens.\r\nOBJECTIVES: Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is an intermediate step in the progression of normal lung tissue to invasive adenocarcinoma. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this progression remain to be fully elucidated due to challenges in obtaining fresh clinical samples for downstream analyses. Formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE) is a tissue preservation system widely used for long-term storage. Until recently, challenges in working with FFPE precluded using new RNA sequencing technologies (RNA-seq), which would help clarify key pathways in cancer progression. Also, isolation techniques including laser-capture micro-dissection provide the ability to select histopathologically distinct tissues, allowing researchers to study transcriptional variations between tightly juxtaposed cell and tissue types.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing these technologies and new alignment tools we examined differential expression of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) and mRNAs across normal, AIS and invasive adenocarcinoma samples from six patients to identify possible markers of lung cancer progression.RESULTS: RNA extracted and sequenced from these 18 samples generated an average of 198 million reads per sample. After alignment and filtering, uniquely aligned reads represented an average 35% of the total reads. We detected differential expression of a number of lincRNAs and mRNAs when comparing normal to AIS, or AIS to invasive adenocarcinoma. Of these, 5 lincRNAs and 31 mRNAs were consistently up- or down-regulated from normal to AIS and more so to invasive carcinoma. We validated the up-regulation of two mRNAs and one lincRNA by RT-qPCR as proof of principle.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a potential role of not only mRNAs, but also lincRNAs in the progression to invasive adenocarcinoma. We anticipate that these findings will lay the groundwork for future experimental studies of candidate RNAs from FFPE to identify their functional roles in lung cancer.'

aS'Upregulated long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 expression is associated with progression and poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r\nAltered expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with human carcinogenesis. We performed a cDNA microarray analysis of lncRNA expression in 12 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 4 non-tumor nasopharyngeal epitheliums. One lncRNA, actin filament associated protein 1 antisense RNA1 (AFAP1-AS1), was identified and selected for further study. AFAP1-AS1 expression was upregulated in NPC and associated with NPC metastasis and poor prognosis. In vitro experiments demonstrated that AFAP1-AS1 knockdown significantly inhibited the NPC cell migration and invasive capability. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown also increased AFAP1 protein expression. Proteomic and bioinformatics analyses suggested that AFAP1-AS1 affected the expression of several small GTPase family members and molecules in the actin cytokeratin signaling pathway. AFAP1-AS1 promoted cancer cell metastasis via regulation of actin filament integrity. AFAP1-AS1 might be a potential novel marker that can predict cancer patient prognosis and as a potential therapeutic target for NPC.'

aS'Two deletions overlapping a distant FOXF1 enhancer unravel the role of lncRNA LINC01081 in etiology of alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins.\r\nPosition effects due to disruption of distant cis-regulatory regions have been reported for over 40 human gene loci; however, the underlying mechanisms of long-range gene regulation remain largely unknown. We report on two patients with alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of pulmonary veins (ACDMPV) caused by overlapping genomic deletions that included a distant FOXF1 transcriptional enhancer mapping 0.3 Mb upstream to FOXF1 on 16q24.1. In one patient with atypical late-onset ACDMPV, a \xe2\x88\xbc1.5 Mb deletion removed the proximal 43% of this enhancer, leaving the lung-specific long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene LINC01081 intact. In the second patient with severe neonatal-onset ACDMPV, an overlapping \xe2\x88\xbc194 kb deletion disrupted LINC01081. Both deletions arose de novo on maternal copy of the chromosome 16, supporting the notion that FOXF1 is paternally imprinted in the human lungs. RNAi-mediated knock-down of LINC01081 in normal fetal lung fibroblasts showed that this lncRNA positively regulates FOXF1 transcript level, further indicating that decrease in LINC01081 expression can contribute to development of ACDMPV.'

aS"Long noncoding RNA MEG3 is downregulated in cervical cancer and affects cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating miR-21.\r\nRecent research has found that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in various human cancers. However, the role of these lncRNAs in cervical cancer remains unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the biological function of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), a cancer-related lncRNA, and its underlying mechanism in cervical cancer. In this study, MEG3 expression of 108 patients' cervical cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues was detected by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR), and the functional effect of MEG3 was determined in vitro assays. We observed that MEG3 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, compared to the adjacent normal tissues, and was negatively related with FIGO stages, tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, HR-HPV infection and the expression of homo sapiens microRNA-21 (miR-21). Furthermore, we focused on the function and molecular mechanism of MEG3, finding that overexpression of MEG3 reduced the level of miR-21-5p expression, causing inhibition of proliferation and increased apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. In summary, our findings indicate that MEG3 function as a tumor suppressor by regulating miR-21-5p, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth in cervical cancer. As a result, this study improves our understanding of the function of MEG3 in cervical cancer and will help to provide new potential target sites for cervical cancer treatment."

aS'A long noncoding RNA Sox2ot regulates lung cancer cell proliferation and is a prognostic indicator of poor survival.\r\nSox2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), localized on human chromosome 3q26.33, which is frequently amplified in lung squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). However, its roles in lung cancer remain under investigation. In this study, we found that Sox2ot was up-regulated over two folds in 53.01% of human primary lung cancers (44/83). The expression level of Sox2ot is significantly higher in SCCs than that in adenocarcinomas (ADCs) of the lung. Further study found high Sox2ot expression predicted poor survival in lung cancer patients (P=0.0053), implying Sox2ot is a novel prognostic factor. In two human lung cancer cell lines, HCC827 and SK-MES-1, knocking down Sox2ot inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G2/M arrest, with a concomitant decrease of cells in S phase. Reduced protein levels of Cyclin B1 and Cdc2 were also observed. Importantly, knocking down Sox2ot decreased EZH2 expression and reintroduction of EZH2 allowed Sox2ot knockdown cells progressed through G2/M phase, which correlates with the restoration of Cyclin B1 and Cdc2 expressions. Altogether, our data suggested that Sox2ot plays an important role in regulating lung cancer cell proliferation, and may represent a novel prognostic indicator for the disease.'

aS'Expression Quantitative Trait Loci for CARD8 Contributes to Risk of Two Infection-Related Cancers--Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Cervical Cancer.\r\nCaspase recruitment domain family, member 8 (CARD8) can coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses and sensitize cells to apoptosis, which may participate in tumorigenesis of virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cervical cancer. By bioinformatics analyses, we identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a new identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for CARD8. In this study, we therefore hypothesized that CARD8 eQTLs SNPs within lncRNA may influence the risk of HCC and cervical cancer. We performed two independent case-control studies of 1,300 cases with HBV-positive HCC and 1,344 normal controls, together with 1,486 cervical cancer patients and 1,536 control subjects to test the association between eQTLs SNP (rs7248320) for CARD8 and the risk of HCC and cervical cancer. The variant genotype of rs7248320 was significantly associated with increased risk of HCC and cervical cancer [GG vs. AA/GA: adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.61, P = 0.028 for HCC; adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.09-1.66, P = 0.006 for cervical cancer]. Moreover, the effect of rs7248320 on cervical cancer risk was more prominent in premenopausal women. Further interactive analysis detected a significantly multiplicative interaction between rs7248320 and menopausal status on cervical cancer risk (P = 0.018). These findings suggest that CARD8 eQTLs SNP may serve as a susceptibility marker for virus-related HCC and cervical cancer.'

aS'Microarray Analysis of Long Non-coding RNA Expression Profile Associated with 5-Fluorouracil-Based Chemoradiation Resistance in Colorectal Cancer Cells.\r\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy is a standard treatment for locally advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). However, CRC cells often develop chemoradiation resistance (CRR). Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays critical roles in a myriad of biological processes and human diseases, as well as chemotherapy resistance. Since the roles of lncRNAs in 5-FU-based CRR in human CRC cells remain unknown, they were investigated in this study.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-FU-based concurrent CRR cell model was established using human CRC cell line HCT116. Microarray expression profiling of lncRNAs and mRNAs was undertaken in parental HCT116 and 5-FU-based CRR cell lines.RESULTS: In total, 2,662 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 2,398 mRNAs were identified in 5-FU-based CRR HCT116 cells when compared with those in parental HCT116. Moreover, 6 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs found to be differentially expressed were validated by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis for the differentially expressed mRNAs indicated involvement of many, such as Jak- STAT, PI3K-Akt and NF-kappa B signaling pathways. To better understand the molecular basis of 5-FU-based CRR in CRC cells, correlated expression networks were constructed based on 8 intergenic lncRNAs and their nearby coding genes.CONCLUSIONS: Changes in lncRNA expression are involved in 5-FU-based CRR in CRC cells. These findings may provide novel insight for the prognosis and prediction of response to therapy in CRC patients.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA LOC389641 promotes progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and increases cell invasion by regulating E-cadherin in a TNFRSF10A-related manner.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators in pathological processes, yet their potential roles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that a novel lncRNA, LOC389641, was upregulated in PDAC tissues and cell lines. The expression of LOC389641 was significantly correlated with staging, lymph node metastasis and overall survival. Knockdown of LOC389641 impaired cell proliferation and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in vitro, whereas overexpression of LOC389641 had the opposite effect. The growth promoting effect of LOC389641 was also demonstrated in vivo. Further, a significant negative correlation was observed between E-cadherin levels and LOC389641 levels in vivo. Knockdown of LOC389641 upregulated E-cadherin expression, but knockdown of E-cadherin had a limited influence on LOC389641. Importantly, after E-cadherin was inhibited, the enhancement of LOC389641 on cell invasion was hindered. Moreover, the expression of LOC389641 was closely associated with its genomic neighboring gene TNFRSF10A. Lastly, knockdown experiments showed that TNFRSF10A might be a connection between LOC389641and E-cadherin. We conclude that LOC389641 promotes PDAC progression and increases cell invasion by regulating E-cadherin with the possible involvement of TNFRSF10A.'

aS'lncRNA-AC130710 targeting by miR-129-5p is upregulated in gastric cancer and associates with poor prognosis.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cancer occurrence and development. However, there is largely unknown about lncRNAs significance in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. In our study, we focused on AC130710, one of lncRNAs. Gastric cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were gathered from 78 patients with gastric cancer. The AC130710 levels were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then, we further analyzed the association between AC130710 level and the clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer. Finally, the molecular mechanism underling AC130710 highly expressed in gastric cancer cells was explored. The results showed that AC130710 in cancer tissues from patients with gastric cancer was significantly higher than those in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05). Its expression level was significantly associated with tumor size (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.013), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.030), and distal metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.018). AC130710 expression in MGC-803 was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa cell line GES-1 (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). Moreover, miR-129-5p may play an important role in the downregulation of AC130710 in gastric cancer cells. These results indicated that lncRNA-AC130710 may be a potential tumor marker for gastric cancer prognosis.'

aS'Upregulation of the long noncoding RNA PCAT-1 correlates with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis in esophageal squamous carcinoma.\r\nRecent studies reveal that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical regulatory roles in cancer biology. Prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcript 1 (PCAT-1) is one of the lncRNAs involved in cell apoptosis and proliferation of prostate cancer. This study aimed to assess the potential role of PCAT-1 specifically in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of PCAT-1 in matched cancerous tissues and adjacent noncancerous tissues from 130 patients with ESCC, 34 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and 30 patients with gastric carcinoma (GC). The correlation of PCAT-1 with clinicopathological features and prognosis were also analyzed. The expression of PCAT-1 was significantly higher in human ESCC compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissues (70.8%, p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01), and the high level of PCAT-1 expression was significantly correlated with invasion of the tumor (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.024), advanced clinical stage (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.003), lymph node metastasis (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.032), and poor prognosis. However, PCAT-1 mRNA expression had no significant difference between paired primary cancerous tissues and the adjacent noncancerous tissues in 34 cases of NSCLC (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.293) and 30 cases of GC (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.125). High expression of PCAT-1 was specifically correlated with invasion of cancer tissues, metastasis of lymph node, and advanced tumor stage of ESCC. High expression of PCAT-1 might reflect poor prognosis of ESCC and indicate a potential diagnostic target in ESCC patients. Adjuvant therapy targeting PCAT-1 molecule might be effective in treatment of ESCC.'

aS'miR-203 suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting oncogene ADAM9 and oncogenic long non-coding RNA HULC.\r\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been integrated into tumorigenic programs by regulating genes at post-transcriptional level. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel targets for miRNAs. Here, we reported that miR-203 down-regulation was closely linked to advanced clinical features and poor overall survival (OS) of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We also confirmed that miR-203 and oncogene ADAM9 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9)/oncogenic long non-coding RNA HULC (highly up-regulated in liver cancer) were inversely expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues or cell lines. More intriguingly, up-regulation of miR-203 diminished the expression of ADAM9 and HULC in HCC cancer cells. Over-expression of miR-203 could markedly inhibit cell proliferation, invasion and induce cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified that miR-203 modulated ADAM9 and HULC in a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Over-expression of HULC partly rescued the miR-203-mediated antitumor effects. These results suggested that miR-203 played tumor suppressive roles by downregulating ADAM9 and HULC and indicated its potential application in cancer treatment.'

aS'Genomic analysis of drug resistant pancreatic cancer cell line by combining long non-coding RNA and mRNA expression profling.\r\nRecently, more and more studies show that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a very important role in various biological processes. However, research on lncRNA in the tumor cell drug resistance of it is seldom reported. In this study, gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line SWl990/GZ was obtained by treating parental cell line SWl990 in vitro with increasing dosage of gemcitabine in culture medium intermittently for ten months. We identified 4983 of 13310 detected lncRNAs demonstrated &gt; 2-fold abnormally expressed in response to the gemcitabine-resistant, among of them, 1993 and 2990 lncRNAs were upregulated and downregulated. Meanwhile, 4759 mRNAs exhibited at least a 2-fold, of these, 2671 and 2088 mRNAs were upregulated and downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis and Pathway analysis revealed that differential expression mRNA involved in significant biological regulatory function and some genes may be particular to pancreatic cancer chemotherapy resistance. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the changes of six lncRNAs (RP11-58D2.1, lincRNA-ZNF532, AP000221.1, CTC-338M12.5, CR619813, DDX6P) and nine mRNAs (SYT1, FAM171B, ZNF331, FAM187B, CYP1A1, SRXN1, HIST1H2BL, TOMM40L and SPP1) in SW1990 and SW1990/GZ. We also found that the upregulating of gemcitabine on the expression of lincRNA-ZNF532 was time-dependent. Gemcitabine at a range from 1.0 \xce\xbcM to 16.0 \xce\xbcM induced a increase of lincRNA-ZNF532 in SW1990 cells. The relative level of DDX6P is opposite to that of lincRNA-ZNF53 in the same circumstance. In conclusion, the dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs identified in this work may represent good candidates for future diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.'

aS'Decreased expression of long non-coding RNA WT1-AS promotes cell proliferation and invasion in gastric cancer.\r\nTumor recurrence and metastasis remain the major obstacles for the successful treatment of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer. In recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been considered as key regulators of tumor behavior. In this study, we investigated the expression and biological role of a newly-identified cancer-related lncRNA, WT1-AS. We found that WT1-AS expression was significantly down-regulated in tumor tissues compared to matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. The WT1-AS expression level was also associated with tumor size and the clinicopathological stage. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited, and the proportion of G0/G1 cells increased when WT1-AS was ectopically-expressed in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of WT1-AS was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Finally, we found that WT1-AS overexpression could decrease ERK protein phosphorylation. Our study indicates that WT1-AS is significantly down-regulated in gastric cancers and may be correlated with tumor progression.'

aS"Identification of novel long non-coding RNAs in triple-negative breast cancer.\r\nTriple-negative breast carcinomas (TNBC) are characterized by particularly poor outcomes, and there are no established markers significantly associated with prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are subclass of noncoding RNAs that have been recently shown to play critical roles in cancer biology. However, little is known about their mechanistic role in TNBC pathogenesis. In this report, we investigated the expression patterns of lncRNAs from TNBC tissues and matched normal tissues with Agilent Human lncRNA array. We identified 1,758 lncRNAs and 1,254 mRNAs that were differentially expressed (\xe2\x89\xa5 2-fold change), indicating that many lncRNAs are significantly upregulated or downregulated in TNBC. Among these, XR_250621.1 and NONHSAT125629 were the most upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs respectively. qRT-PCR was employed to validate the microarray analysis findings, and results were consistent with the data from the microarrays. GO and KEGG pathway analysis were applied to explore the potential lncRNAs functions, some pathways including microtubule motor activity and DNA replication were identified in TNBC pathogenesis. Our study revealed that a set of lncRNAs were differentially expressed in TNBC tissues, suggesting that they may play role in TNBC. These results shed light on lncRNAs' biological functions and provide useful information for exploring potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer."

aS"Decreased long noncoding RNA SPRY4-IT1 contributing to gastric cancer cell metastasis partly via affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators governing fundamental biological processes, and their disorder expression involves in tumorigenesis. SPRY4-IT1 (SPRY4 intronic transcript 1), a lncRNA derived from an intron within SPRY4 gene, involves in multiple cancers development. However, the expression pattern and biological function of SPRY4-IT1 in gastric cancer is still not well documented. Hence, we carried out the present study to investigate the potential role of SPRY4-IT1 in gastric carcinogenesis.METHODS: QRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of SPRY4-IT1 in 61 pairs of gastric cancer samples. Over-expression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches were used to investigate the biological functions of SPRY4-IT1. The effect of SPRY4-IT1 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and colony formation assays. Gastric cancer cells transfected with pCDNA-SPRY4-IT1 were injected into nude mice to study the effect of SPRY4-IT1 on tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Protein levels of SPRY4-IT1 targets were determined by western blot or fluorescence immunohistochemistry. ChIP assays were performed to investigate the effect of DNMT1 on SPRY4-IT1 expression. Differences between groups were tested for significance using Student's t test (two-tailed).RESULTS: SPRY4-IT1 expression is decreased in gastric cancer tissues and associated with larger tumor size, advanced pathological stage, deeper depth of invasion and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with lower SPRY4-IT1 expression had a relatively poor prognosis. DNA methylation may be a key factor in controlling the SPRY4-IT1 expression. Furthermore, SPRY4-IT1 contributed to gastric cancer cells metastasis might partly via regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.CONCLUSION: Low expression of SPRY4-IT1 is involved in progression and metastasis of gastric cancer and may represent a novel biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer."

aS'Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors and metformin regulate expression of the long non-coding RNA HULC.\r\nSpecificity protein 1 (Sp1) transcription factor (TF) regulates expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. RNA interference (RNAi) studies showed that among several lncRNAs expressed in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells, highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC) was regulated not only by Sp1 but also Sp3 and Sp4 in the three cell lines. Knockdown of Sp transcription factors and HULC by RNAi showed that they play important roles in HCC cell proliferation, survival and migration. The relative contribution of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and HULC on these responses in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells were cell context- and response-dependent. In the poorly differentiated SK-Hep-1 cells, knockdown of Sp1 or HULC resulted in genomic and morphological changes, indicating that Sp1 and Sp1-regulated HULC are important for maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype in this cell line. Genomic analysis showed an inverse correlation between expression of genes after knockdown of HULC and expression of those genes in liver tumors from patients. The antidiabetic drug metformin down-regulates Sp proteins in pancreatic cancer, and similar results including decreased HULC expression were observed in HepG2, SNU-449 and SK-Hep-1 cells treated with metformin, indicating that metformin and other antineoplastic agents that target Sp proteins may have clinical applications for HCC chemotherapy.'

aS'Long noncoding RNAs as putative biomarkers for prostate cancer detection.\r\nProstate cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among US males. There is an urgent unmet need to develop sensitive and specific biomarkers for the early detection of prostate cancer to reduce overtreatment and accompanying morbidity. We identified a group of differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples and further characterized six long noncoding RNAs (AK024556, XLOC_007697, LOC100287482, XLOC_005327, XLOC_008559, and XLOC_009911) in prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples (Gleason score &gt;6.0) and compared them with matched normal (healthy) tissues. Interestingly, these markers were also successfully detected in patient urine samples and were found to be up-regulated when compared with normal (healthy) urine. AK024556 (SPRY4-IT1) was highly up-regulated in human prostate cancer cell line PC3 but not in LNCaP, and siRNA knockdown of SPRY4-IT1 in PC3 cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion and increased cell apoptosis. Chromogenic in situ hybridization assay was developed to detect long noncoding RNAs in primary prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue samples, paving the way for clinical diagnostics. We believe that these results will set the stage for more extensive studies to develop novel long noncoding RNA-based diagnostic assays for early prostate cancer detection and will help to distinguish benign prostate cancer from precancerous lesions.'

aS"Skp2 regulates non-small cell lung cancer cell growth by Meg3 and miR-3163.\r\nMaternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3) encodes a long non-coding RNA that has been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis. Skp2 is a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF that specifically promotes the ubiquitination-associated degradation of CDK inhibitor p27, and has been shown to promote cancer cell growth in different types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nevertheless, a regulatory relationship between Meg3 and Skp2 has not been acknowledged. Here, we showed that NSCLC specimens had significant higher levels of Skp2 and significantly lower levels of Meg3, compared to paired non-tumor lung tissue. The levels of Meg3 and Skp2 were inversely correlated in NSCLC specimens. Patients with low Meg3 levels had a poor survival. Overexpression of Meg3 decreased Skp2 protein and increased p27 protein, while depletion of Meg3 increased Skp2 protein and decreased p27 protein in NSCLC cells, without altering Skp2 mRNA. These data suggest that the Skp2 may be regulated by Meg3 at post-transcriptional level. Bioinformatics analyses showed that miR-3163 bound to 3'-UTR of Skp2 mRNA in NSCLC cells to inhibit its translation, which was supported by luciferase reporter assay. Meg3 augmented the effects of miR-3163 on Skp2 mRNA, possibly through binding-induced function enhancement, which was supported by the double fluorescent in situ hybridization showing co-localized intracellular Meg3 and miR-3163 signals in NSCLC cells. The miR-3163 levels in NSCLC were not different from in NT, suggesting that the regulation of Skp2 in NSCLC by miR-3163 may require coordination of Meg3. Thus, our data suggest that Meg3 and miR-3163 may coordinate suppression of translation of Skp2 mRNA in NSCLC cells to inhibit NSCLC cell growth."

aS'LncRNAs expression in preeclampsia placenta reveals the potential role of LncRNAs contributing to preeclampsia pathogenesis.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes involved in a variety of biological functions. They are aberrantly expressed in many types of diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the lncRNA profiles in preeclampsia. Preeclampsia has been observed in patients with molar pregnancy where a fetus is absent, which demonstrate that the placenta is sufficient to cause this condition. Thus, we analyzed the lncRNA profiles in preeclampsia placentas.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we described the lncRNA profiles in six preeclampsia placentas (T) and five normal pregnancy placentas (N) using microarray. With abundant and varied probes accounting for 33,045 LncRNAs in our microarray, 28,443 lncRNAs that were expressed at a specific level were detected. From the data, we found 738 lncRNAs that were differentially expressed (\xe2\x89\xa5 1.5-fold-change) among preeclampsia placentas compared with controls. Coding-non-coding gene co-expression networks (CNC network) were constructed based on the correlation analysis between the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. According to the CNC network and GO analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs/mRNAs, we selected three lncRNAs to analyze the relationship between lncRNAs and preeclampsia. LOC391533, LOC284100, and CEACAMP8 were evaluated using qPCR in 40 preeclampsia placentas and 40 controls. These results revealed that three lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in preeclampsia placentas compared with controls.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first study to determine the genome-wide lncRNAs expression patterns in preeclampsia placenta using microarray. These results revealed that clusters of lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in preeclampsia placenta compared with controls, which indicated that lncRNAs differentially expressed in preeclampsia placenta might play a partial or key role in preeclampsia development. Misregulation of LOC391533, LOC284100, and CEACAMP8 might contribute to the mechanism underlying preeclampsia. Taken together, this study may provide potential targets for the future treatment of preeclampsia and novel insights into preeclampsia biology.'

aS'Epigenetic and transcriptional features of the novel human imprinted lncRNA GPR1AS suggest it is a functional ortholog to mouse Zdbf2linc.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcribed from the intergenic regions of animal genomes, play important roles in key biological processes. In mice, Zdbf2linc was recently identified as an lncRNA isoform of the paternally expressed imprinted Zdbf2 gene. The functional role of Zdbf2linc remains undefined, but it may control parent-of-origin-specific expression of protein-coding neighbors through epigenetic modification in cis, similar to imprinted Nespas, Kcnq1ot1 and Airn lncRNAs. Here, we identified a novel imprinted long-range non-coding RNA, termed GPR1AS, in the human GPR1-ZDBF2 intergenic region. Although GPR1AS contains no human ZDBF2 exons, this lncRNA is transcribed in the antisense orientation from the GPR1 intron to a secondary, differentially methylated region upstream of the ZDBF2 gene (ZDBF2 DMR), similar to mouse Zdbf2linc. Interestingly, GPR1AS/Zdbf2linc is exclusively expressed in human/mouse placenta with paternal-allele-specific expression and maternal-allele-specific promoter methylation (GPR1/Gpr1 DMR). The paternal-allele specific methylation of the secondary ZDBF2 DMR was established in human placentas as well as somatic lineage. Meanwhile, the ZDBF2 gene showed stochastic paternal-allele-specific expression, possibly methylation-independent, in placental tissues. Overall, we demonstrated that epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the imprinted GPR1-GPR1AS-ZDBF2 region were well-conserved between human and mouse genomes without the high sequence conservation of the intergenic lncRNAs. Our findings also suggest that lncRNAs with highly conserved epigenetic and transcriptional regulation across species arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor, if they do not have identical exon structures.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA Linc-ITGB1 knockdown inhibits cell migration and invasion in GBC-SD/M and GBC-SD gallbladder cancer cell lines.\r\nGallbladder cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with a low 5-year survival rate. Despite advances in the molecular understanding of the initiation and progression in gallbladder cancer, treatment modalities such as surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy in advanced cases did not yield promising outcomes. Therefore, it is of great importance to uncover new mechanism underlying gallbladder cancer growth and metastasis. In this study, we identified a differentially expressed long intergenic non-coding RNA, linc-ITGB1, in a pair of higher and lower metastatic gallbladder cancer cell sublines. Then, the potential role of linc-ITGB1 in gallbladder cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was explored using a lentivirus-mediated RNA interference system. Functional analysis showed that knockdown of linc-ITGB1 significantly inhibited gallbladder cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were reduced by over twofold in linc-ITGB1 knockdown cells probably due to upregulation of \xce\xb2-catenin and downregulation of vimentin, slug, and TCF8. In conclusion, linc-ITGB1 potentially promoted gallbladder cancer invasion and metastasis by accelerating the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the application of RNA interference targeting linc-ITGB1 might be a potential form of gallbladder cancer treatment in advanced cases.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA profiling in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinical significance: potential biomarkers for LSCC.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are novel transcripts that may play important roles in cancer. Our study aimed to resolve the lncRNA profile of larynx squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and to determine its clinical significance. The global lncRNA expression profile in LSCC tissues was measured by lncRNA microarray. Distinctly expressed lncRNAs were identified and levels of AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 lncRNAs in 87 LSCC samples and paired adjacent normal tissue were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The clinical significance of these lncRNAs in laryngeal cancer was analyzed and survival data were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to check the diagnostic value. In the lncRNA expression profile of tumor samples, 684 lncRNAs were upregulated and 747 lncRNAs were downregulated (fold-change &gt;2.0). Of these, AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were distinctly dysregulated, with AC026166.2-001 exhibiting lower expression in cancer tissues and RP11-169D4.1-001 higher expression. We verified that both AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were expressed at a lower level in cervical lymph nodes compared with paired laryngeal cancer tissues and paired normal tissues. RP11-169D4.1-001 levels were positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.007). From the survival analysis, decreased levels of AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 were associated with poorer prognosis. The area under the ROC curve was up to 0.65 and 0.67, respectively, and the cut-off point of \xce\x94Ct was 11.23 and 10.53, respectively. AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 may act as novel biomarkers in LSCC and may be potential therapeutic targets for LSCC patients. Both AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 could be independent prognostic factors for survival in LSCC.'

aS'Potential Role of lncRNAs in Contributing to Pathogenesis of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration Based on Microarray Data.\r\nBACKGROUND: Our study intended to identify potential long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and genes, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microarray of GSE56081 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including 5 human control nucleus pulposus tissues and 5 degenerative nucleus pulposus tissues, which was on the basis of GPL15314 platform. Identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed between the 2 groups. Then, gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to analyze the biological functions and pathways for the differentially expressed mRNAs. Simultaneously, lncRNA-mRNA weighted coexpression network was constructed using the WGCNA package, followed by GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses for the genes in the modules. Finally, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was visualized.RESULTS: A total of 135 significantly up- and 170 down-regulated lncRNAs and 2133 significantly up- and 1098 down-regulated mRNAs were identified. Additionally, UBA52 (ubiquitin A-52 residue ribosomal protein fusion product 1), with the highest connectivity degree in PPI network, was remarkably enriched in the pathway of metabolism of proteins. Eight lncRNAs - LINC00917, CTD-2246P4.1, CTC-523E23.5, RP4-639J15.1, RP11-363G2.4, AC005082.12, MIR132, and RP11-38F22.1 - were observed in the modules of lncRNA-mRNA weighted coexpression network. Moreover, SPHK1 in the green-yellow module was significantly enriched in positive regulation of cell migration.CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs LINC00917, CTD-2246P4.1, CTC-523E23.5, RP4-639J15.1, RP11-363G2.4, AC005082.12, MIR132, and RP11-38F22.1 were differentially expressed and might play important roles in the development of IDD. Key genes, such as UBA52 and SPHK1, may be pivotal biomarkers for IDD.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA Loc554202 regulates proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells.\r\nData derived from massive cloning and traditional sequencing methods have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) play important roles in the development and progression of cancer. Although many studies suggest that the lncRNAs have different cellular functions, many of them are not yet to be identified and characterized for the mechanism of their functions. To address this question, we assay the expression level of lncRNAs-Loc554202 in breast cancer tissues and find that Loc554202 is significantly increased compared with normal control, and associated with advanced pathologic stage and tumor size. Moreover, knockdown of Loc554202 decreased breast cancer cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and inhibits migration/invasion in vitro and impeded tumorigenesis in vivo. These data suggest an important role of Loc554202 in breast tumorigenesis.'

aS"The Long Noncoding RNA IFNG-AS1 Promotes T Helper Type 1 Cells Response in Patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.\r\nThe long noncoding (lnc) RNA-Ifng-AS1 plays an essential role in the transcription of the gene encoding IFN-\xce\xb3 by Th1 cells, and its human ortholog, IFNG-AS1, is expressed in human Th1 cells. However, IFNG-AS1 contributing to Th1 cells' response in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients has not been reported. Twenty-eight HT patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The proportion of circulating Th1 cells and the level of T-bet, IFNG mRNA were increased in HT patients, the expression of IFNG-AS1 was upregulated and positively correlated with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells or T-bet, and IFNG expression, or serum level of anti-thyroglobulin antibody/thyroperoxidase antibody in HT patients. IFNG-AS1 regulated the expression of IFNG at both transcriptional and translational level in human CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, strong positive correlations between the increased transcript level of IFNG-AS1 and the increased transcript level of T-bet or IFNG were revealed in thyroid tissues from HT patients. Our results indicate that enhanced expression of lncRNA-IFNG-AS1 contributes to Th1 cell response in HT patients and may be involved in the pathogenesis of HT."

aS'Expression of LINC00312, a long intergenic non-coding RNA, is negatively correlated with tumor size but positively correlated with lymph node metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r\nThe long intergenic non-coding RNA LINC00312, also called NAG7, was first cloned by our group. Our previous studies have found that LINC00312 could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells but also stimulate NPC cell invasion. However, the relevance of LINC00312 in NPC progression or in patient outcomes has not been reported. This study aims to assess the possible correlations of LINC00312 expression with NPC progression and its potential prognostic predictive ability in NPC outcomes. A NPC tissue microarray, which included 561 normal and NPC tissue cores, was used to detect LINC00312 expression, and we found that LINC00312 was significantly down-regulated in NPC tissues compared with non-cancerous nasopharyngeal epithelium tissues. Positive expression of LINC00312 was negatively correlated with tumor size (P &lt; 0.001) but positively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that LINC00312 expression could distinguish non-cancerous patients from NPC patients (P &lt; 0.001, sensitivity: 72.1 %, specificity: 87.7 %). We also found that LINC00312 was strongly negatively correlated with EBER-1, a non-coding RNA transcribed by Epstein-Barr Virus, in NPC (r = -0.384, P &lt; 0.001). In the final logistic regression analysis model, the abnormal expression of LINC00312 and EBER-1 were found to be independent contributors to nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, respectively). A survival analysis revealed that LINC00312 could predict a good prognosis of no lymph node metastasis (Disease Free Survival (DFS): P = 0.005, Overall Survival (OS): P = 0.001) and a poor prognosis of lymph node metastasis (DFS: P = 0.011, OS: P = 0.001) in NPC patients. Low expression of LINC00312 was an independent risk factor for OS in multivariate analyses (P = 0.017). These observations indicated that LINC00312 could represent a potential biomarker for metastasis, progression and prognosis in NPC.'

aS'Identification of long noncoding RNA associated with osteoarthritis in humans.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of genes involved in various biological functions; however, knowledge about lncRNAs in osteoarthritis (OA) is limited. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify which lncRNAs are expressed in OA versus normal cartilage.METHODS: To identify lncRNAs specifically expressed in OA cartilage, expression of lncRNAs in OA cartilage was compared with that in normal cartilage using microarray analysis. The identified differences in expression of lncRNAs were validated by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, expression of several key mRNAs associated with OA, including those for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-13, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, COL2A1 and ADAMTS5, was investigated by RT-PCR in OA and normal cartilage.RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 121 lncRNAs that were up- or down-regulated in OA compared with normal tissue, 73 being upregulated and 48 downregulated compared with normal cartilage. Twenty-one of the above differently expressed lncRNAs were up-regulated twofold. Expression of six lncRNAs, including HOTAIR, GAS5, PMS2L2, RP11-445H22.4, H19 and CTD-2574D22.4, was up-regulated in OA compared with normal tissue as validated by RT-PCR after microarray analysis. Expression of mRNA for MMP-9, MMP-13, BMP-2, and ADAMTS5 in OA was significantly greater than in normal cartilage. However, expression of mRNA for COL2A1 was lower in OA than in normal cartilage.CONCLUSION: The differently expressed lncRNAs may be associated with the pathogenesis of OA. Further functional studies are critical to confirming the function of lncRNAs in OA and to exploring new potential targets for therapy.'

aS'Knockdown of long non-coding RNA MALAT1 increases the blood-tumor barrier permeability by up-regulating miR-140.\r\nThe blood-tumor barrier (BTB) forms a major obstacle in brain tumor therapy by preventing the delivery of sufficient quantities of therapeutic drugs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in both normal development and diseases including cancer. Here, we elucidated the expression of lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and defined its functional role in the regulation of BTB function as well as its possible molecular mechanisms. Our results proved that MALAT1 expression was up-regulated in brain microvessels of human glioma and glioma endothelial cells (GECs) which were obtained by co-culturing endothelial cells with glioma cells. Functionally, knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in an impairment and increased the permeability of BTB as well as decreased the expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Further, there was reciprocal repression between MALAT1 and miR-140, and miR-140 mediated the effects that MALAT1 knockdown exerted. Mechanistic investigations defined that nuclear factor YA (NFYA), a CCAAT box-binding transcription factor, was a direct and functional downstream target of miR-140, which was involved in the MALAT1 knockdown induced regulation of BTB function. Furthermore, NFYA could up-regulate the promoter activities and bind to the promoters of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 in GECs. Taken together, we have demonstrated the fact that knockdown of MALAT1 resulted in the increased permeability of BTB, which might contribute to establishing potential therapeutic strategies for human gliomas.'

aS'Long noncoding RNAs in mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency and differentiation.\r\nThe transcriptional networks that regulate embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and lineage specification are the subject of considerable attention. To date such studies have focused almost exclusively on protein-coding transcripts. However, recent transcriptome analyses show that the mammalian genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which appear to be expressed in a developmentally regulated manner. The functions of these remain untested. To identify ncRNAs involved in ES cell biology, we used a custom-designed microarray to examine the expression profiles of mouse ES cells differentiating as embryoid bodies (EBs) over a 16-d time course. We identified 945 ncRNAs expressed during EB differentiation, of which 174 were differentially expressed, many correlating with pluripotency or specific differentiation events. Candidate ncRNAs were identified for further characterization by an integrated examination of expression profiles, genomic context, chromatin state, and promoter analysis. Many ncRNAs showed coordinated expression with genomically associated developmental genes, such as Dlx1, Dlx4, Gata6, and Ecsit. We examined two novel developmentally regulated ncRNAs, Evx1as and Hoxb5/6as, which are derived from homeotic loci and share similar expression patterns and localization in mouse embryos with their associated protein-coding genes. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence that both ncRNAs are associated with trimethylated H3K4 histones and histone methyltransferase MLL1, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation of homeotic loci during ES cell differentiation. Taken together, our data indicate that long ncRNAs are likely to be important in processes directing pluripotency and alternative differentiation programs, in some cases through engagement of the epigenetic machinery.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA CCAT2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer and associated with poor prognosis.\r\nINTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in tumor progression. The aim of our study was to explore the clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of lncRNA CCAT2 expression in human gastric cancer.METHODS: Expression levels of lncRNA CCAT2 in 85 pairs of gastric cancer and adjacent non-tumor tissues were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In order to determine its prognostic value, overall survival and progression-free survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis.RESULTS: Expression levels of lncRNA CCAT2 in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent non-tumor tissues. By statistical analyses, high lncRNA CCAT2 expression was observed to be closely correlated with higher incidence of lymph node metastasis and distance metastasis. Moreover, patients with high lncRNA CCAT2 expression had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared with the low lncRNA CCAT2 group. Multivariate analyses indicated that high lncRNA CCAT2 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that up-regulation of lncRNA CCAT2 was correlated with gastric cancer progression, and lncRNA CCAT2 might be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients.'

aS'Upregulated lncRNA-UCA1 contributes to progression of lung cancer and is closely related to clinical diagnosis as a predictive biomarker in plasma.\r\nOBJECTIVE: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important regulatory roles in cancer biology, and the lncRNA-UCA1 is upregulated in several cancers such as bladder cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer, however, the contributions of UCA1 to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown.METHODS: Expression levels of lncRNA-UCA1 in tumor tissues and plasma from NSCLC patients was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR, and its association with overall survival of patients was analyzed by statistical analysis. Moreover, the UCA1 expression correlation between tumor tissues and plasma was demonstrated by linear regression analysis.RESULTS: the results showed that the expression of UCA1 in NSCLC tissues was obviously higher than that observed in pair-matched adjacent nontumourous tissues, (P &lt; 0.001). The agarose gel electrophoretogram of RT-PCR products further confirmed that UCA1 was increased in NSCLC tissues. To assess the correlation of UCA1 expression with Clinicopathological data, we found that the expression level of UCA1 was associate with histological grade (P &lt; 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P &lt; 0.001). Intriguingly, the expression of UCA1 was significantly increased in plasma from NSCLC patients. The UCA1 expression measurements obtained from plasma and tumor tissues were strongly correlated in 60 patient samples (r = 0.881). By receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, plasma UCA1 provided the highly diagnostic performance for detection of NSCLC (the area under the ROC curve (AUC), 0.886; P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the current results indicated that Plasma UCA1 could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of NSCLC. UCA1 as a biomarker in clinical application might significantly improve the efficacy of human NSCLC screening.'

aS'Increased expression of the lncRNA PVT1 is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients.\r\nAIM: Long non-coding RNA PVT1 (lncRNA PVT1) has been identified and it plays an oncogenic role in various human cancers. However, its roles in pancreatic cancer remain unclear. The aim of this paper was to explore the PVT1 expression levels and relationship with survival of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to establish the significance of PVT1 in the development and progression of PDAC.METHODS: In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze the expression levels of lncRNA PVT1 in paired PDAC and adjacent nontumor tissues. The association of PVT1 expression with clinicopathological features was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to analyze the association of PVT1 expression with overall survival rate of patients with PDAC. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were carried out to analyze the prognostic significance of PVT1 expression.RESULTS: The study results showed that the PVT1 expression was significantly increased in PDAC tissues compared to adjacent nontumor tissues. The expression of PVT1 was associated with clinical stage and N-classification (P&lt;0.05). Patients with high PVT1 expression level had shorter overall survival times compared to those with low PVT1 expression level (P&lt;0.05). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses suggested that PVT1 might be an independent prognostic factor for poor overall survival rate in patients with PDAC.CONCLUSION: The study findings suggested that the increased expression of lncRNA PVT1 in PDAC was correlated with tumor progression, and PVT1 might be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with PDAC.'

aS"Predictive polymer modeling reveals coupled fluctuations in chromosome conformation and transcription.\r\nA new level of chromosome organization, topologically associating domains (TADs), was recently uncovered by chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques. To explore TAD structure and function, we developed a polymer model that can extract the full repertoire of chromatin conformations within TADs from population-based 3C data. This model predicts actual physical distances and to what extent chromosomal contacts vary between cells. It also identifies interactions within single TADs that stabilize boundaries between TADs and allows us to identify and genetically validate key structural elements within TADs. Combining the model's predictions with high-resolution DNA FISH and quantitative RNA FISH for TADs within the X-inactivation center (Xic), we dissect the relationship between transcription and spatial proximity to cis-regulatory elements. We demonstrate that contacts between potential regulatory elements occur in the context of fluctuating structures rather than stable loops and propose that such fluctuations may contribute to asymmetric expression in the Xic during X inactivation."

aS'CRNDE, a long-noncoding RNA, promotes glioma cell growth and invasion through mTOR signaling.\r\nThe transcripts of the gene Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) are recognized as long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are expressed in specific regions within the human brain, and are the most upregulated lncRNA in gliomas. However, the underlying regulation and function of CRNDE in gliomas are largely unknown. In this study, the upregulation of CRNDE was confirmed in both primary specimens from glioma patients and in vitro with cell lines. Overexpression of specific CRNDE transcript promotes cell growth and migration in vitro while knockdown of CRNDE expression manifests a repressive function during these cellular processes. The growth promoting effect of CRNDE was also demonstrated in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic studies further revealed that histone acetylation in the promoter region might account for the upregulation of CRNDE, and the level of CRNDE expression could be modulated by mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in glioma. Thus, our results shed a light on utilizing CRNDE as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma.'

aS"MINCR is a MYC-induced lncRNA able to modulate MYC's transcriptional network in Burkitt lymphoma cells.\r\nDespite the established role of the transcription factor MYC in cancer, little is known about the impact of a new class of transcriptional regulators, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), on MYC ability to influence the cellular transcriptome. Here, we have intersected RNA-sequencing data from two MYC-inducible cell lines and a cohort of 91 B-cell lymphomas with or without genetic variants resulting in MYC overexpression. We identified 13 lncRNAs differentially expressed in IG-MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma and regulated in the same direction by MYC in the model cell lines. Among them, we focused on a lncRNA that we named MYC-induced long noncoding RNA (MINCR), showing a strong correlation with MYC expression in MYC-positive lymphomas. To understand its cellular role, we performed RNAi and found that MINCR knockdown is associated with an impairment in cell cycle progression. Differential gene expression analysis after RNAi showed a significant enrichment of cell cycle genes among the genes down-regulated after MINCR knockdown. Interestingly, these genes are enriched in MYC binding sites in their promoters, suggesting that MINCR acts as a modulator of the MYC transcriptional program. Accordingly, MINCR knockdown was associated with a reduction in MYC binding to the promoters of selected cell cycle genes. Finally, we show that down-regulation of Aurora kinases A and B and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 may explain the reduction in cellular proliferation observed on MINCR knockdown. We, therefore, suggest that MINCR is a newly identified player in the MYC transcriptional network able to control the expression of cell cycle genes."

aS"Low expression of long noncoding RNA GAS6-AS1 predicts a poor prognosis in patients with NSCLC.\r\nLung cancer is the most frequent cancer in China and all over the world. Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs play critical roles in multiple biological processes including oncogenesis. In this study, we reported a new lncRNA GAS6-AS1 (GAS6 antisense RNA 1), whose expression was downregulated in tumor tissues in 50 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with those in the adjacent normal tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, decreased GAS6-AS1 expression was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.032) and advanced tumor node metastasis stage (P = 0.003). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that GAS6-AS1 expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival (P = 0.036). Also, GAS6-AS1 level was inversely correlated with GAS6 (growth-arrest-specific gene6) mRNA level (Pearson's correlation -0.620). In conclusion, our study demonstrated that altered lncRNA GAS6-AS1 expression might be involved in the development and progression of NSCLC by influencing its host gene and promised to be a potential diagnostic target in patients with NSCLC."

aS'DNMT1-associated long non-coding RNAs regulate global gene expression and DNA methylation in colon cancer.\r\nThe cancer epigenome exhibits global loss of DNA methylation, which contributes to genomic instability and aberrant gene expression by mechanisms that are yet to be fully elucidated. We previously discovered over 3300 long non-coding (lnc)RNAs in human cells and demonstrated that specific lncRNAs regulate gene expression via interactions with chromatin-modifying complexes. Here, we tested whether lncRNAs could also associate with DNA methyltransferases to regulate DNA methylation and gene expression. Using RIP-seq, we identified a subset of lncRNAs that interact with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in a colon cancer cell line, HCT116. One lncRNA, TCONS_00023265, which we named DACOR1 (DNMT1-associated Colon Cancer Repressed lncRNA 1), shows high, tissue-specific expression in the normal colon (including colon crypts) but was repressed in a panel of colon tumors and patient-derived colon cancer cell lines. We identified the genomic occupancy sites of DACOR1, which we found to significantly overlap with known differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in colon tumors. Induction of DACOR1 in colon cancer cell lines significantly reduced their ability to form colonies in vitro, suggesting a growth suppressor function. Consistent with the observed phenotype, induction of DACOR1 led to the activation of tumor-suppressor pathways and attenuation of cancer-associated metabolic pathways. Notably, DACOR1 induction resulted in down-regulation of Cystathionine \xce\xb2-synthase, which is known to lead to increased levels of S-adenosyl methionine-the key methyl donor for DNA methylation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that deregulation of DNMT1-associated lncRNAs contributes to aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression during colon tumorigenesis.'

aS'Expression and clinical significance of long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 in human gastric cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in the occurrence and development of human cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). However, the functional and clinical significance of lncRNAs are still poorly understood.METHODS: In this study, the expression of LncRNA HNF1A antisense RNA 1 (HNF1A-AS1) was first examined by lncRNAs microarray analysis in 6 GC tissues, and was then further verified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) both in 3 GC cell lines and 161 cases of GC tissues. We also evaluated the association between HNF1A-AS1 expression and clinicopathological features of patients with GC.RESULTS: LncRNAs microarray analysis results exhibited that HNF1A-AS1 was downregulated in GCs tissues (mean fold change 2.06, p\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.05), which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR. The results from qRT-PCR showed that the expression of HNF1A-AS1 was not only downregulated in three GC cell lines (AGS, BGC-823, and MKN-45) relative to that in a normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line (GES-1), but also decreased in GC tissues relative to that in paired adjacent non-neoplastic tissues (low expression, 94 of 161; low expression rate, 58.38%). Furthermore, low HNF1A-AS1 expression was associated with tumor size/diameter (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005, multivariate analysis), levels of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and RRM1 expression in tissue samples (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.028, p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.009, and p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.006, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data indicate that lncRNA HNF1A-AS1 may be a regulator of GC, and thus, it may have potential as a novel biomarker and treatment target for this type of cancer.'

aS'Plasma long noncoding RNA protected by exosomes as a potential stable biomarker for gastric cancer.\r\nLong intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 152 (LINC00152) is one of the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) abnormally expressed in gastric cancer tissues. However, its value in the diagnosis of gastric cancer is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of plasma LINC00152 as a biomarker in the screening of gastric cancer and to explore the possible mechanism underling its stable existence in blood. We analyzed the levels of plasma LINC00152 in patients with gastric cancer and gastric epithelial dysplasia and healthy controls using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and then confirmed by sequencing. We also compared its levels in paired preoperative and postoperative plasma samples. In addition, we compared the levels of LINC00152 in plasma and in exosomes, which were extracted from the same plasma and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of plasma LINC00152 were significantly elevated in gastric cancer patients compared with healthy controls. The sensitivity and specificity of plasma LINC00152 in the diagnosis of gastric cancer were 48.1 and 85.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences of LINC00152 levels between gastric epithelial dysplasia patients and healthy controls. LINC00152 levels in preoperative plasma samples were lower than those in postoperative ones. There were also no differences between LINC00152 levels in plasma and in exosomes. All these results suggested that LINC00152 can be detected in plasma, and one of the possible mechanisms of its stable existence in blood was protected by exosomes. It has the possibility to be applied in gastric cancer diagnosis as a novel blood-based biomarker.'

aS'The Use of Three Long Non-Coding RNAs as Potential Prognostic Indicators of Astrocytoma.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pervasively transcribed and play a key role in tumorigenesis. The aim of the study was to determine the lncRNA expression profile in astrocytomas and to assess its potential clinical value. We performed a three-step analysis to establish the lncRNA profile for astrocytoma: a) the lncRNA expression was examined on 3 astrocytomas as well as 3 NATs (normal adjacent tissues) using the lncRNA microarray; b) the top-hits were validated in 40 astrocytomas (WHO grade II-IV) by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR); c) the hits with significant differences were re-evaluated using qRT-PCR in 90 astrocytomas. Finally, 7 lncRNAs were found to have a significantly different expression profile in astrocytoma samples compared to the NAT samples. Unsupervised clustering analysis further revealed the potential of the 7-lncRNA profile to differentiate between tumors and NAT samples. The upregulation of ENST00000545440 and NR_002809 was associated with advanced clinical stages of astrocytoma. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we showed that the low expression of BC002811 or XLOC_010967, or the high expression of NR_002809 was significantly associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed that this prognostic impact was independent of other clinicopathological factors. Our results indicate that the lncRNA profile may be a potential prognostic biomarker for the prediction of post-surgical outcomes.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA Gm15055 represses Hoxa gene expression by recruiting PRC2 to the gene cluster.\r\nThe Hox genes encode transcription factors that determine embryonic pattern formation. In embryonic stem cells, the Hox genes are silenced by PRC2. Recent studies have reported a role for long noncoding RNAs in PRC2 recruitment in vertebrates. However, little is known about how PRC2 is recruited to the Hox genes in ESCs. Here, we used stable knockdown and knockout strategies to characterize the function of the long noncoding RNAGm15055 in the regulation of Hoxa genes in mouse ESCs. We found that Gm15055 is highly expressed in mESCs and its expression is maintained by OCT4.Gm15055 represses Hoxa gene expression by recruiting PRC2 to the cluster and maintaining the H3K27me3 modification on Hoxa promoters. A chromosome conformation capture assay revealed the close physical association of the Gm15055 locus to multiple sites at the Hoxa gene cluster in mESCs, which may facilitate the in cis targeting of Gm15055RNA to the Hoxa genes. Furthermore, an OCT4-responsive positive cis-regulatory element is found in the Gm15055 gene locus, which potentially regulates both Gm15055 itself and the Hoxa gene activation. This study suggests how PRC2 is recruited to the Hoxa locus in mESCs, and implies an elaborate mechanism for Hoxa gene regulation in mESCs.'

aS'A potential signature of eight long non-coding RNAs predicts survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Accumulated evidence suggests that dysregulated expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play a critical role in tumorigenesis and prognosis of cancer, indicating the potential utility of lncRNAs as cancer prognostic or diagnostic markers. However, the power of lncRNA signatures in predicting the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not yet been investigated.METHODS: We performed an array-based transcriptional analysis of lncRNAs in large patient cohorts with NSCLC by repurposing microarray probes from the gene expression omnibus database. A risk score model was constructed based on the expression data of these eight lncRNAs in the training dataset of NSCLC patients and was subsequently validated in other two independent NSCLC datasets. The biological implications of prognostic lncRNAs were also analyzed using the functional enrichment analysis.RESULTS: An expression pattern of eight lncRNAs was found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients in the training dataset. With the eight-lncRNA signature, patients of the training dataset could be classified into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different OS (median survival 1.67 vs. 6.06 years, log-rank test p = 4.33E-09). The prognostic power of eight-lncRNA signature was further validated in other two non-overlapping independent NSCLC cohorts, demonstrating good reproducibility and robustness of this eight-lncRNA signature in predicting OS of NSCLC patients. Multivariate regression and stratified analysis suggested that the prognostic power of the eight-lncRNA signature was independent of clinical and pathological factors. Functional enrichment analyses revealed potential functional roles of the eight prognostic lncRNAs in tumorigenesis.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the eight-lncRNA signature may be an effective independent prognostic molecular biomarker in the prediction of NSCLC patient survival.'

aS'HULC and Linc00152 Act as Novel Biomarkers in Predicting Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND/AIMS: The alterations of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are related to multiple diseases. They can be detected in plasma as biomarkers for the diagnosis of multiple diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the expression of circulating lncRNAs in human, which may be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).METHODS: Eight lncRNAs were chosen as candidates on the basis of the literature to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of the plasma lncRNA profiling system. The candidate lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR arranged in the training and validation sets. Additional double-blind testing was performed in 20 patients clinically suspected of having HCC.RESULTS: Circulating HULC and Linc00152 were significantly up-regulated in plasma samples of HCC patients during training set and validation set. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the validated two lncRNAs signature were 0.78 and 0.85, respectively. Combination of HULC and Linc00152 possessed a moderate ability to discrimination between HCC and control with an area under ROC value of 0.87 while the combination of AFP was 0.89 with a positive correlation with tissues expression.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both plasma levels of HULC and Linc00152 achieve a fine diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing ontogenesis and metastasis of HCC and may act as novel biomarkers for HCC.'

aS'Identification of Stably Expressed lncRNAs as Valid Endogenous Controls for Profiling of Human Glioma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Recent research indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) represent a new family of RNAs that is of fundamental importance for controlling transcription and translation. Thereby, there is increasing evidence that lncRNAs are also important in tumourigenesis. Thereby valid expression profiling using quantitative PCR requires suitable, stably expressed normalisers to achieve reliable and reproducible data. However, no systematic analysis of suitable references in lncRNA studies in human glioma has been performed yet.METHODS: In this study, we investigated 90 lncRNAs in 30 tissue specimen for the expression stability in human diffuse astrocytoma (WHO-Grade II), anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO-Grade III) and glioblastoma (WHO-Grade IV) both alone as well as in comparison with normal white matter. Our identification procedure included a rigorous bioinformatical selection process that resulted in the inclusion of only highly abundant, equally expressed lncRNAs for further analysis. Additionally, lncRNAs were classified according to their stability value using the NormFinder algorithm.RESULTS: We identified 24 appropriate normalisers suitable for studies in diffuse astrocytoma, 22 for studies in anaplastic astrocytoma and 12 for studies in glioblastoma. Comparing all three glioma entities 7 lncRNAs showed stable expression levels. Addition of normal brain tissue resulted in only 4 suitable lncRNAs.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that 4 lncRNAs (HOXA6as, H19 upstream conserved 1 and 2, Zfhx2as and BC200) are suitable as normalisers in glioma and normal brain. These lncRNAs may thus be regarded as universal references being applicable for the accurate normalisation of lncRNA expression profiling in various glioma (WHO-Grades II-IV) alone and in combination with brain tissue. This enables to perform valid longitudinal studies, e.g. of glioma before and after malignisation to identify changes of lncRNA expressions probably driving malignant transformation.'

aS'[Expression of long non-coding RNA associated with radiotherapy-resistance in colorectal cancer cell lines with different radiosensitivity].\r\nOBJECTIVE: To screen long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) associated with radiosensitivity in colorectal carcinoma cell lines.METHODS: Colony formation assay was performed in colorectal cancer cell lines HT29, SW480, RKO, Lovo and HCT116 after irradiation with different radiation doses. Radiation sensitivity of these 5 cell lines was detected through survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2 value). High-throughput lncRNA chip was used to screen lncRNA genes with expression differences more than 2 folds among SW480, RKO and Lovo. Further experiment on the expression differences of lncRNAs selected was conducted by realtime PCR.RESULTS: The radiosensitivity order of these 5 cell lines from low to high (SF2 value from high to low) was HT29 (0.83 \xc2\xb1 0.03), SW480 (0.69 \xc2\xb1 0.02), RKO(0.53 \xc2\xb1 0.02), Lovo (0.47 \xc2\xb1 0.05), HCT116 (0.32 \xc2\xb1 0.03) (P &lt; 0.01). Five lncRNAs associated with radiation sensitivity were screened. Among them, expression levels of R05532, NR_015441, and NR_033374 were positively correlated with radiation resistance(all P &lt; 0.01), and expression levels of the other 2 lncRNAs, NR_073156 and AA745020, were not correlated with radiation resistance of colorectal cancer cells (both P&gt;0.05).CONCLUSIONS: lncRNA R05532, NR_015441 and NR_033374 may be used as the predictive marker of radiosensitivity of colorectal cancer cells. Higher expression of these genes shows radiation resistance.'

aS'Low expression of lncRNA-HMlincRNA717 in human gastric cancer and its clinical significances.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been gradually confirmed to be tumor-associated biological molecules in recent years. However, the clinical significances of most lncRNAs in the screening of gastric cancer are largely unknown. Based on our lncRNA array results, in this study, we explored the potential relationship between HMlincRNA717 expression levels and clinicopathologic factors of gastric cancer. A total of 313 samples were collected from two cancer centers, and then HMlincRNA717 level in human gastric cancer tissues and gastric cell lines was measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Then, HMlincRNA717 levels at multiple stages of gastric tumorigenesis were investigated and the potential association between it levels, and clinicopathological features were analyzed. The expression levels of HMlincRNA717 in five gastric cancer cell lines, AGS, BGC-823, HGC-27, MGC-803, and SGC-7901, were significantly downregulated than those in normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell line GES-1. It was not only downregulated in 62.6 % (67/107) gastric cancer tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal tissues but also in gastric precancerous lesions. More importantly, our results indicated that HMlincRNA717 expression levels were correlated with cancer distal metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.034), venous invasion (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.029), and nervous invasion (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.024). Our data suggested that lncRNA-HMlincRNA717 may play crucial roles during cancer occurrence and progression and may be a new potential biomarker of early gastric cancer.'

aS'Involvement of extracellular vesicle long noncoding RNA (linc-VLDLR) in tumor cell responses to chemotherapy.\r\nHepatocellular cancer (HCC) is a highly treatment-refractory cancer and is also highly resistant to adverse cellular stress. Although cell behavior can be modulated by noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) within extracellular vesicles (EV), the contributions of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are largely unknown. To this end, the involvement and functional roles of lncRNAs contained within EVs during chemotherapeutic stress in human HCC were determined. Expression profiling identified a subset of lncRNAs that were enriched in tumor cell-derived vesicles released from two different cell lines. Of these, lincRNA-VLDLR (linc-VLDLR) was significantly upregulated in malignant hepatocytes. Exposure of HCC cells to diverse anticancer agents such as sorafenib, camptothecin, and doxorubicin increased linc-VLDLR expression in cells as well as within EVs released from these cells. Incubation with EVs reduced chemotherapy-induced cell death and also increased linc-VLDLR expression in recipient cells. RNAi-mediated knockdown of linc-VLDLR decreased cell viability and abrogated cell-cycle progression. Moreover, knockdown of VLDLR reduced expression of ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G member 2), whereas overexpression of this protein reduced the effects of VLDLR knockdown on sorafenib-induced cell death. Here, linc-VLDLR is identified as an EV-enriched lncRNA that contributes to cellular stress responses.IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide new insight into the role of EVs and demonstrate the capacity of lncRNAs to mediate chemotherapeutic stress response in HCC.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA Linc00152 is involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer.\r\nGastric cancer remains a serious threat to public health with high incidence and mortality worldwide. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in regulating gene expression and are involved in various pathological processes, including gastric cancer. To investigate the possible role of dysregulated lncRNAs in gastric cancer development, we performed lncRNA microarray and identified 3141 significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs in gastric cancer tissues. Next, some of deregulated lncRNAs were validated among about 60 paired gastric cancer specimens such as Linc00261, DKFZP434K028, RPL34-AS1, H19, HOTAIR and Linc00152. Our results found that the decline of DKFZP434K028 and RPL34-AS1, and the increased expression of Linc00152 positively correlated with larger tumor size. The high expression levels of HOTAIR were associated with lymphatic metastasis and poor differentiation. Since the biological roles of Linc00152 are largely unknown in gastric cancer pathogenesis, we assessed its functions by silencing its up-regulation in gastric cancer cells. We found that Linc00152 knockdown could inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation, promote cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, trigger late apoptosis, reduce the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, and suppress cell migration and invasion. Taken together, we delineate the gastric cancer lncRNA signature and demonstrate the oncogenic functions of Linc00152. These findings may have implications for developing lncRNA-based biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutics for gastric cancer.'

aS'Expression profile of long non-coding RNAs is altered in endometrial cancer.\r\nThis study was to uncover the role of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in the process of endometrial cancer (EC) development using microarray technique to obtain the expression profiles of lncRNAs in EC and its adjacent normal tissues. A total of 45 pieces of pathologically-proven EC tissues were used in this study. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after resection and stored at -80\xc2\xb0C for future use. The detection of lncRNA and transcripts was conducted using microarray analysis. To understand the biochemical function of lncRNA, bioinformatics analyses (gene ontology and pathway analyses) were performed. To further investigate the relationship between lncRNAs and EC, subgroup analysis was conducted. In order to validate the consistency of the lncRNAs with microarray data, qRT-PCR was performed. In this study, 30586 lncRNAs and 26109 transcripts (fold change \xe2\x89\xa5 2.0) were found in the tested EC. In particular, compared with normal tissues, 4010 the lncRNA were up-regulated, and 3350 of them were down-regulated. Seven of the lncRNAs were in accordance with microarray data in qRT-PCR. Among these lncRNAs, 3 were up-regulated and 4 were down-regulated. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that 24 pathways were correlated to the up-regulated transcripts, while 27 pathways were associated with the down-regulated transcripts. Our study demonstrated that the expressions of a large amount of lncRNAs were altered in EC in comparison to normal tissues, suggesting that lncRNAs could potentially serve as a diagnostic biomarker that is beneficial for the diagnosis and therapy of EC.'

aS'Long noncoding RNAs expression signatures in chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been established to participate in various biological processes that are crucial for development and differentiation. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the mechanisms of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiation are not completely understood. The purpose of the study was to investigate the expression profiles of lncRNAs during the chondrogenic differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs, with a view to studying the biological function of lncRNAs and their involvement in the mechanism of differentiation. We compared the lncRNAs expression profiles of undifferentiated and differentiated cells during chondrogenic differentiation by microarray. 3638 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified (fold-change &gt;2.0 or &lt;-2.0, P&lt;0.05), consisting of 2166 up-regulated and 1472 down-regulated. Microarray data were validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analyses were applied for further study of these differentially expressed lncRNAs. Among these lncRNAs, ZBED3-AS1 and CTA-941F9.9 were further analyzed with co-expression network and target prediction analysis. The results showed that the two up-regulated lncRNAs are likely to play important roles in chondrogenic differentiation process. In conclusion, the expression profile of lncRNAs was significantly altered during differentiation process. It provided a new insight on complicated regulation mechanisms of human bone marrow MSCs chondrogenic differentiation.'

aS'Increased expression of LncRNA BANCR is associated with clinical progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), emerging non-coding RNAs, have been proved to serve as a critical role in the proliferation, metastasis apoptosis of gastric cancer. However little is known about the clinical significance of BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) in gastric cancer. The aim of our study is to identify the clinical value of BANCR in gastric cancer patients. Expression of BANCR was analyzed in one hundred and eighty-four gastric cancer samples using Real-time PCR. In our results, the expression of BANCR was increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with paired adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, high expression of BANCR was positively associated with clinical stage, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis in gastric cancer patients. In survival analysis, high expression of BANCR was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients. In summary, overexpression of BANCR acts as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer patients.'

aS"The long non-coding RNA HOTTIP enhances pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, survival and migration.\r\nHOTTIP is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from the 5' tip of the HOXA locus and is associated with the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) and WD repeat containing protein 5 (WDR5)/mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) chromatin modifying complexes. HOTTIP is expressed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and knockdown of HOTTIP by RNA interference (siHOTTIP) in Panc1 pancreatic cancer cells decreased proliferation, induced apoptosis and decreased migration. In Panc1 cells transfected with siHOTTIP, there was a decrease in expression of 757 genes and increased expression of 514 genes, and a limited gene analysis indicated that HOTTIP regulation of genes is complex. For example, Aurora kinase A, an important regulator of cell growth, is coregulated by MLL and not WDR5 and, in contrast to previous studies in liver cancer cells, HOTTIP does not regulate HOXA13 but plays a role in regulation of several other HOX genes including HOXA10, HOXB2, HOXA11, HOXA9 and HOXA1. Although HOTTIP and the HOX-associated lncRNA HOTAIR have similar pro-oncogenic functions, they regulate strikingly different sets of genes in Panc1 cells and in pancreatic tumors."

aS'Macrophage infiltration promotes invasiveness of breast cancer cells via activating long non-coding RNA UCA1.\r\nThere is now considerable evidence supporting the view that macrophage infiltration is playing a critical role in the proliferation and progression of breast cancer but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. To this end, using long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiling, we examined changes in lncRNA expression in breast cancer cells treated with conditioned medium (CM) from cultured human THP-1 macrophages. We found that treatment with macrophage CM induced the expression of numerous lncRNAs, including urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1). Knockdown of UCA1 using shRNA inhibited AKT phosphorylation and abolished invasiveness of tumor cells induced by macrophage CM. Consistent with these results; we further showed that UCA1 level was significantly enhanced in human primary breast tumors and correlated with advanced clinical stage, supporting its role in promoting carcinogenesis and progression of breast cancer. Together, these results suggest that macrophage could promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells by enhancing expression of lncRNA UCA1.'

aS'A functional variant in HOXA11-AS, a novel long non-coding RNA, inhibits the oncogenic phenotype of epithelial ovarian cancer.\r\nThe homeobox A (HOXA) region of protein-coding genes impacts female reproductive system embryogenesis and ovarian carcinogenesis. The 5-prime end of HOXA includes three long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (HOXA10-AS, HOXA11-AS, and HOTTIP) that are underexplored in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We evaluated whether common genetic variants in these lncRNAs are associated with EOC risk and/or have functional roles in EOC development. Using genome-wide association study data from 1,201 serous EOC cases and 2,009 controls, an exonic variant within HOXA11-AS, rs17427875 (A&gt;T), was marginally associated with reduced serous EOC risk (OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78-1.01, p = 0.06). Functional studies of ectopic expression of HOXA11-AS minor allele T in EOC cells showed decreased survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion compared to common allele A expression. Additionally, stable expression of HOXA11-AS minor allele T reduced primary tumor growth in mouse xenograft models to a greater extent than common allele A. Furthermore, HOXA11-AS expression levels were significantly lower in human EOC tumors than normal ovarian tissues (p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that HOXA11-AS has a tumor suppressor function in EOC which may be enhanced by the T allele. These findings demonstrate for the first time a role for HOXA11-AS in EOC with effects that could be modified by germline variants.'

aS'Low expression of LOC285194 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) study has gradually become one of the hot topics in the field of RNA biology. One lncRNA which has attracted attention is LOC285194, a lncRNA demonstrated the potential tumor-suppressor role in osteosarcoma. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of LOC285194 in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and to investigate the relationship between this lncRNA levels and existing clinicopathologic parameters and patient survival.METHODS: The expression of LOC285194 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in pairs of tumorous and adjacent normal tissues of 81 colorectal cancer patients with a follow-up of 5 years, as well as in three colorectal cancer cell lines and normal intestinal mucous cell line. Then, we analyzed the potential relationship between this lncRNA levels in tumor tissues and existing clinicopathological features of CRC, and clinical outcome.RESULTS: The relative expression levels of LOC285194 was significantly lower in tumor tissues (p&lt;0.001) and colorectal cancer cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissues and normal intestinal mucous cell line. In addition, low expression of LOC285194 was correlated with larger tumor size (p=0.015), higher tumor stage (p=0.034), and more distant metastasis (p=0.046). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with low LOC285194 expression had a poor disease free survival (p=0.010). Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that decreased expression of LOC285194 was an independent predictor of disease-specific survival.CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that LOC285194 might be a novel prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer and may be a potential target for diagnosis and gene therapy.'

aS"Genome-wide association study implicates a novel RNA gene, the lincRNA AC068718.1, as a risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorder in women.\r\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder with a particularly high burden for women. Emerging evidence suggests PTSD may be more heritable among women and evidence from animal models and human correlational studies suggest connections between sex-linked biology and PTSD vulnerability, which may extend to the disorder's genetic architecture. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PTSD in a primarily African American sample of women from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS) and tested for replication in an independent cohort of primarily European American women from the Nurses Health Study II (NHSII). We genotyped 413 DNHS women - 94 PTSD cases and 319 controls exposed to at least one traumatic event - on the Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip for &gt;700,000 markers and tested 578 PTSD cases and 1963 controls from NHSII for replication. We performed a network-based analysis integrating data from GWAS-derived independent regions of association and the Reactome database of functional interactions. We found genome-wide significant association for one marker mapping to a novel RNA gene, lincRNA AC068718.1, for which we found suggestive evidence of replication in NHSII. Our network-based analysis indicates that our top GWAS results were enriched for pathways related to telomere maintenance and immune function. Our findings implicate a novel RNA gene, lincRNA AC068718.1, as risk factor for PTSD in women and add to emerging evidence that non-coding RNA genes may play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of gene regulation with putative pathological effects that lead to phenotypic differences."

aS'Downregulated Long Noncoding RNA BANCR Promotes the Proliferation of Colorectal Cancer Cells via Downregualtion of p21 Expression.\r\nBRAF activated non-coding RNA (BANCR), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is crucial for cell migration in melanoma cells and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. However, little is known regarding the role of this gene in the proliferation of colorectal cancer. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of BANCR in the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells. In this study, we show that BANCR expression was significantly down-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared with normal tissues, and overexpression of BANCR suppressed colorectal cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also determined that pCDNA-BANCR-mediated colorectal cancer cell proliferation was associated with induction of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis enhancement through regulation of p21, and its effects were most likely posttranscriptional. Taken together, our findings suggest that down-regulation of BANCR contributes to the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells, at least in part, through the regulation of p21 protein.'

aS'Genetic variants in long non-coding RNA MIAT contribute to risk of paranoid schizophrenia in a Chinese Han population.\r\nThe heritability of schizophrenia has been reported to be as high as ~80%, but the contribution of genetic variants identified to this heritability remains to be estimated. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are involved in multiple processes critical to normal cellular function and dysfunction of lncRNA MIAT may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the genetic evidence of lncRNAs involved in schizophrenia has not been documented. Here, we conducted a two-stage association analysis on 8 tag SNPs that cover the whole MIAT locus in two independent Han Chinese schizophrenia case-control cohorts (discovery sample from Shanxi Province: 1093 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 1180 control subjects; replication cohort from Jilin Province: 1255 cases and 1209 healthy controls). In discovery stage, significant genetic association with paranoid schizophrenia was observed for rs1894720 (\xcf\x87(2)=74.20, P=7.1E-18), of which minor allele (T) had an OR of 1.70 (95% CI=1.50-1.91). This association was confirmed in the replication cohort (\xcf\x87(2)=22.66, P=1.9E-06, OR=1.32, 95%CI 1.18-1.49). Besides, a weak genotypic association was detected for rs4274 (\xcf\x87(2)=4.96, df=2, P=0.03); the AA carriers showed increased disease risk (OR=1.30, 95%CI=1.03-1.64). No significant association was found between any haplotype and paranoid schizophrenia. The present studies showed that lncRNA MIAT was a novel susceptibility gene for paranoid schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population. Considering that most lncRNAs locate in non-coding regions, our result may explain why most susceptibility loci for schizophrenia identified by genome wide association studies were out of coding regions.'

aS'ROR functions as a ceRNA to regulate Nanog expression by sponging miR-145 and predicts poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.\r\nlncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of tumor development and progression. ROR is a typical lncRNA that plays important regulatory roles in the pathogenesis and progression of tumors. Nevertheless, current understanding of the involvement of ROR in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis remains limited. In this study, we measured ROR in 61 paired cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples by qRT-PCR and investigated the biological role of ROR on the phenotypes of pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs) in vitro and in vivo. The effects of ROR on PCSCs were studied by RNA interference approaches in vitro and in vivo. Insights of the mechanism of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) were gained from bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assays and RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation. The positive ROR/Nanog interaction was identified and verified by immunohistochemistry assay. Compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, ROR was up-regulated in most tumor tissues. Knockdown of ROR by RNA interference in PCSCs inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and decreased migration. Moreover, ROR silencing resulted in significantly decreased tumourigenicity of PCSCs in nude mice than controls. In particular, ROR may act as a ceRNA, effectively becoming a sink for miR-145, thereby activating the derepression of core transcription factors Nanog. In conclusions, we demonstrated that decreased ROR expression could inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and tumourigenicity by modulating Nanog. Therefore, ROR is a potential novel prognostic marker to predict the clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer patients after surgery and may be a rational target for therapy.'

aS'A novel lncRNA, LUADT1, promotes lung adenocarcinoma proliferation via the epigenetic suppression of p27.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are known to regulate the development and progression of various cancers. However, few lncRNAs have been well characterized in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Here, we identified the expression profile of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes via microarrays analysis of paired LUAD tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from five female non-smokes with LUAD. A total of 498 lncRNAs and 1691 protein-coding genes were differentially expressed between LUAD tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues. A novel lncRNA, LUAD transcript 1 (LUADT1), which is highly expressed in LUAD and correlates with T stage, was characterized. Both in vitro and in vivo data showed that LUADT1 knockdown significantly inhibited proliferation of LUAD cells and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0-G1 phase. Further analysis indicated that LUADT1 may regulate cell cycle progression by epigenetically inhibiting the expression of p27. RNA immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that LUADT1 binds to SUZ12, a core component of polycomb repressive complex 2, and mediates the trimethylation of H3K27 at the promoter region of p27. The negative correlation between LUADT1 and p27 expression was confirmed in LUAD tissue samples. These data suggested that a set of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes were differentially expressed in LUAD. LUADT1 is an oncogenic lncRNA that regulates LUAD progression, suggesting that dysregulated lncRNAs may serve as key regulatory factors in LUAD progression.'

aS'Plasma level of metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 is associated with liver damage and predicts development of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nRecent studies have shown that metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was overexpressed in many human solid cancers, however, its roles in plasma of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients were unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of plasma MALAT1 levels in HCC patients. Plasma samples were collected from pre-operative HCC, hepatic disease patients, and healthy controls, and tissue samples from HCC patients and colorectal cancer patients with liver metastasis. Plasma and tissue MALAT1 levels were measured. Plasma MALAT1 levels were progressively and significantly higher in HCC patients than hepatic disease patients, and higher in hepatic disease patients than healthy controls. The expression of MALAT1 in HCC tissue was slightly higher than that in paired non-cancerous liver tissue, but not significant. The expression of MALAT1 in the non-cancerous liver tissue of 20 HCC patients was significantly higher than that in normal liver tissue of 13 colorectal cancer patients. In contrast, plasma MALAT1 levels were significantly low in HCC patients with hepatitis B infection, and significantly high in patients with liver damage B or liver cirrhosis. In a receiver-operator curve analysis of HCC and hepatic disease patients, the cut-off value of plasma MALAT1 was 1.60 and the area under the curve was 0.66. Plasma MALAT1 levels were not correlated with \xce\xb1-fetoprotein or protein induced by vitamin K absence II, whereas sensitivity and specificity for the detection of HCC with the combination of MALAT1, \xce\xb1-fetoprotein, and protein induced by vitamin K absence II were 88.6% and 75%, respectively. In conclusion, the plasma MALAT1 level is associated with liver damage, and has clinical utility for predicting development of HCC.'

aS'p53-dependent non-coding RNA networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\r\nMutations of the tumor suppressor p53 lead to chemotherapy resistance and a dismal prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Whereas p53 targets are used to identify patient subgroups with impaired p53 function, a comprehensive assessment of non-coding RNA targets of p53 in CLL is missing. We exploited the impaired transcriptional activity of mutant p53 to map out p53 targets in CLL by small RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of p53-dependent microRNA/non-coding RNA induced in response to DNA damage in CLL. Besides the key p53 target miR-34a, we identify a set of p53-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs; miR-182-5p, miR-7-5p and miR-320c/d). In addition to miRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) are induced in response to DNA damage in the presence of functional p53 but not in CLL with p53 mutation. Induction of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 are closely correlated to the induction of cell death after DNA damage. We used isogenic lymphoma cell line models to prove p53 dependence of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21. The current work describes the p53-dependent miRNome and identifies lncRNAs NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 as novel elements of the p53-dependent DNA damage response machinery in CLL and lymphoma.'

aS"The long non-coding RNA HNF1A-AS1 regulates proliferation and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of tumor development and progression. The lncRNA HNF1A-antisense 1 (HNF1A-AS1) is a 2455-bp transcript on chromosome 12 with a potential oncogenic role in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Nevertheless, current understanding of the involvement of HNF1A-AS1 in lung adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis remains limited. In this study, we analyzed the roles of HNF1A-AS1 in 40 lung adenocarcinoma tissues and five lung cancer cell lines. Our results showed that HNF1A-AS1 was significantly up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with corresponding non-tumor tissues, and its expression level was significantly correlated with TNM stage, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser's Kaplan-Meier plot suggested that patients in the high HNF1A-AS1 expression subgroup experienced worse overall survival compared to the low expression subgroup. Moreover, HNF1A-AS1 was determined to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis, both in vitro and in vivo, by regulating cyclin D1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and \xce\xb2-catenin expression. In addition, the binding of HNF1A-AS1 to DNMT1 may explain its regulation of E-cadherin. In conclusions, we demonstrated that increased HNF1A-AS1 expression could regulate cell proliferation and metastasis and identified it as a poor prognostic biomarker in lung adenocarcinoma."

aS'The lincRNA HOTAIRM1, located in the HOXA genomic region, is expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, impacts prognosis in patients in the intermediate-risk cytogenetic category, and is associated with a distinctive microRNA signature.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are deregulated in several tumors, although their role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is mostly unknown.We have examined the expression of the lncRNA HOX antisense intergenic RNA myeloid 1 (HOTAIRM1) in 241 AML patients. We have correlated HOTAIRM1 expression with a miRNA expression profile. We have also analyzed the prognostic value of HOTAIRM1 expression in 215 intermediate-risk AML (IR-AML) patients.The lowest expression level was observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (P &lt; 0.001) and the highest in t(6;9) AML (P = 0.005). In 215 IR-AML patients, high HOTAIRM1 expression was independently associated with shorter overall survival (OR:2.04;P = 0.001), shorter leukemia-free survival (OR:2.56; P &lt; 0.001) and a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (OR:1.67; P = 0.046). Moreover, HOTAIRM1 maintained its independent prognostic value within the favorable molecular subgroup (OR: 3.43; P = 0.009). Interestingly, HOTAIRM1 was overexpressed in NPM1-mutated AML (P &lt; 0.001) and within this group retained its prognostic value (OR: 2.21; P = 0.01). Moreover, HOTAIRM1 expression was associated with a specific 33-microRNA signature that included miR-196b (P &lt; 0.001). miR-196b is located in the HOX genomic region and has previously been reported to have an independent prognostic value in AML. miR-196b and HOTAIRM1 in combination as a prognostic factor can classify patients as high-, intermediate-, or low-risk (5-year OS: 24% vs 42% vs 70%; P = 0.004).Determination of HOTAIRM1 level at diagnosis provided relevant prognostic information in IR-AML and allowed refinement of risk stratification based on common molecular markers. The prognostic information provided by HOTAIRM1 was strengthened when combined with miR-196b expression. Furthermore, HOTAIRM1 correlated with a 33-miRNA signature.'

aS'Expression of long non-coding RNA LOC285194 and its prognostic significance in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nINTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays critical roles in tumor progression. lncRNA LOC285194 was previously shown to be correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis in several cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate relationship between LOC285194 expression and clinical outcomes in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was performed to detect the expression of lncRNA LOC285194 in human PDAC cells and tissue samples. The association of LOC285194 expression with clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess survival of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze the prognostic significance of LOC285194 expression.RESULTS: Our data showed that the relative level of LOC285194 in PDAC cells was significantly lower than that in normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line. Also, the expression of LOC285194 in PDAC tissues was significantly lower than that in adjacent non-tumor tissues. By statistical analyses, low LOC285194 expression was observed to be closely correlated with clinical stage, lymphnode metastasis and liver metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with low LOC285194 expression had a poor overall survival compared with the high LOC285194 group (P &lt; 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that low LOC285194 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for PDAC patients.CONCLUSIONS: Our data provided the first evidence that reduced LOC285194 in PDAC tissues was correlated with tumor progression, and lncRNA LOC285194 might be a potential molecular biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients.'

aS'Downregulation of NUF2 inhibits tumor growth and induces apoptosis by regulating lncRNA AF339813.\r\nRecent studies have shown that NUF2 (Ndc80 kinetochore complex component) play important roles in multiple human cancers. In our previous report, NUF2 expression was stronger in tumor tissues than in normal pancreatic tissues. However, whether and how NUF2 play a role in pancreatic cancer progression remains largely unknown. The aim of our study is to investigate the expression and functional role of NUF2 in human PC. NUF2 expression was measured in 10 pairs of PC cancerous and noncancerous tissue samples by quantitative real-time PCR. The effects of NUF2 on PC cells were studied by RNA interference. Apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells viability was evaluated using MTT. CDK4/CDK6 activity was measured by Western blot assay. LncRNAs regulated by NUF2 were gained from bioinformatics analysis. The role of LncRNA AF339813, regulated by NUF2, was finally characterized in PC cells by siRNA. Our results showed that NUF2 mRNA and protein were significantly overexpressed in Human PC tissues and several PC cell lines. Through bioinformatics analysis and knockdown NUF2 in PC cells, we found LncRNA AF339813 was positively regulated by NUF2. We further demonstrated that knockdown of AF339813 by siRNA in PC cells significantly reduced cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Thus, we conclude that NUF2 is consistently overexpressed in human PC and NUF2 is closely linked with human PC progression through the meditator LncRNA AF339813.

aS'Tumor suppressor long non-coding RNA, MT1DP is negatively regulated by YAP and Runx2 to inhibit FoxA1 in liver cancer cells.\r\nRecent studies are indicative for strong carcinogenetic roles of Runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and Yes associated protein (YAP) in several cancer types. However, whether and how the interaction between Runx2 and YAP plays a role in liver tumorigenesis still remain illusive. Here, we identified a close relationship between Runx2 and YAP in liver cancer cells. Runx2 had a positive role on YAP expression and vice versa. We also found that Rux2 and YAP were capable of inhibiting long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Metallothionein 1D, Pseudogene (MT1DP) expression through direct promoter binding. Overexpression of MT1DP resulted in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation in soft agar, but increased apoptosis in liver cancer cells, whereas knockdown of this lncRNA had the opposite effect, indicating that MT1DP acts as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, MT1DP was revealed as a negative regulator of Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), a classic liver cancer tumor marker, through inhibiting protein synthesis of Forkhead box A1 (FoxA1), an important transcription factor in liver development and cancer progression. Furthermore, we found that FoxA1 plays a positive role on YAP and Runx2 expression. Specially, opening the compacted chromatin by FoxA1 around CREB binding site within the YAP promoter facilitates CREB-mediated YAP transcription. Finally, MT1DP-inhibited in vivo liver cancer cell growth could be rescued by a combination of overexpression of FoxA1, Runx2 and YAP. Taken together, the close relationship between Rnux2 and YAP plays a pro-carcinogenetic role in liver cancer cells through inhibiting tumor suppressor lncRNA, MT1DP in a FoxA1 dependent manner.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA HULC modulates abnormal lipid metabolism in hepatoma cells through an miR-9-mediated RXRA signaling pathway.\r\nHULC is a long noncoding RNA overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its functional contributions in this setting have not been determined. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that HULC contributes to malignant development by supporting abnormal lipid metabolism in hepatoma cells. HULC modulated the deregulation of lipid metabolism in HCC by activating the acyl-CoA synthetase subunit ACSL1. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays revealed that approximately 77% (180/233) of HCC tissues were positive for ACSL1. Moreover, HULC mRNA levels correlated positively with ACSL1 levels in 60 HCC cases according to real-time PCR analysis. Mechanistic investigations showed that HULC upregulated the transcriptional factor PPARA, which activated the ACSL1 promoter in hepatoma cells. HULC also suppressed miR-9 targeting of PPARA mRNA by eliciting methylation of CpG islands in the miR-9 promoter. We documented the ability of HULC to promote lipogenesis, thereby stimulating accumulation of intracellular triglycerides and cholesterol in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, ACSL1 overexpression that generates cholesterol was sufficient to enhance the proliferation of hepatoma cells. Further, cholesterol addition was sufficient to upregulate HULC expression through a positive feedback loop involving the retinoid receptor RXRA, which activated the HULC promoter. Overall, we concluded that HULC functions as an oncogene in hepatoma cells, acting mechanistically by deregulating lipid metabolism through a signaling pathway involving miR-9, PPARA, and ACSL1 that is reinforced by a feed-forward pathway involving cholesterol and RXRA to drive HULC signaling.'

aS'Decreased expression of long non-coding RNA NBAT-1 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\r\nOBJECTIVE: accumulating evidence suggest that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play important roles in human cancers. LncRNA neuroblastoma associated transcript-1 (NBAT-1) was initially identified to be involved in the progression of neuroblastoma. However, there is no report about the role of NBAT-1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical significant of NBAT-1 in ccRCC.METHODS: the expression pattern of NBAT-1 in ccRCC patients and renal cancer cell lines was detected by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and its correlation with clinicopathologic features and prognosis of patients with ccRCC was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model, respectively. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into 786-O and ACHN cells to determine the effect of NBAT-1 knockdown on renal cancer cells.RESULT: NBAT-1 expression is significantly decreased in ccRCC tissues and renal cancer cells compared with adjacent normal tissues and normal human proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2, and its low level is associated with advanced features and poor prognosis. Also, multivariate analysis identified NBAT-1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for ccRCC. In vitro assays indicated that knockdown of NBAT-1 expression increased renal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.CONCLUSIONS: NBAT-1 is a novel molecular correlated with ccRCC progression; and it may represent a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in renal cancer diagnosis and treatment.'

aS'Notch 1 promotes cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer formation by upregulating lncRNA AK022798 expression.\r\nGastric cancer is now the fourth most common malignancy and the second leading cause of death because of cancer. The resistance to anticancer drugs is the main cause of chemotherapy failure. In this study, we explored the role of Notch 1 and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in drug-resistant gastric cancer formation. First, we found that Notch 1 was highly expressed in the cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell lines SGC7901/DDP and BGC823/DDP cells. Then, we constructed a Notch 1 overexpression vector plasmid; after successful transfection, the SGC7901 and BGC823 cells highly expressed Notch 1. Moreover, the expression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), P-glycoprotein, increased significantly and the apoptosis of SGC7901 and BGC823 cells obviously reduced. We further screened out the lncRNA AK022798 involved in this process. Furthermore, we used siRNA to interfere with lncRNA AK022798 expression, and found that the expression of MRP1 and P-glycoprotein decreased significantly in SGC7901/DDP and BGC823/DDP cells, and their apoptosis as well as the expressions of caspase 3 and caspase 8 obviously increased. These results suggest that Notch 1 can promote the lncRNA AK022798 expression and result in the formation of SGC7901/DDP and BGC823/DDP cells. It may provide a new, useful method for gastric cancer chemotherapy.'

aS'Differential expression of long noncoding RNA in primary and recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\r\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies suggested that non-protein-coding genes are implicated in the tumorigenic process of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In the present study, we aimed to identify the differentially expressed long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) using data available in the public domain.METHODS: Microarray data set GSE12452 was reannotated with ncFANs. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify and validate the identified lncRNAs in NPC.RESULTS: In primary NPC, upregulation of lnc-C22orf32-1, lnc-AL355149.1-1, and lnc-ZNF674-1 was observed. High levels of lnc-C22orf32-1 and lnc-AL355149.1-1 were significantly associated with the male patients. In addition, increased expression of lnc-C22orf32-1 and lnc-ZNF674-1 was associated with advanced tumor stages. Recurrent NPC displayed a distinctive lncRNA expression pattern. lnc-BCL2L11-3 was significantly increased in the recurrent NPC tissues. In addition, significant reduction of lnc-AL355149.1-1 and lnc-ZNF674-1 was observed in the recurrent NPC tissues.CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that it is feasible to identify the differentially expressed lncRNA in the microarray dataset by functional reannotation. The association of lncRNA with gender and tumor size implicated that lncRNA possibly plays a part in the pathogenesis of primary NPC. Further, the distinctive lncRNA identified in the recurrent NPC may reveal a distinctive development mechanism underlying tumor recurrence.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA linc-ITGB1 promotes cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer.\r\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women globally. Its high morbidity and mortality, as well as its elevated tendency to metastasize to other organs, warrant the urgency to find new biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The specific roles of long noncoding RNA linc-ITGB1 on cell proliferation and metastasis in breast cancer were explored in this study. The expression of linc-ITGB1 was significantly upregulated in both clinical breast cancer tissues and cultured breast cancer cell lines. The linc-ITGB1 knockdown with specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) decreased cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. Tumor growth in vivo was also inhibited by linc-ITGB1 depletion. In addition, linc-ITGB1 depletion caused cell accumulation in the G0/G1 phase. Breast cancer cell lines with linc-ITGB1 depletion exhibited decreased migration and invasion abilities compared with the control cells. Furthermore, the linc-ITGB1 knockdown decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin while increasing the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Key cell cycle regulators Cdc25C and Cyclin B1 were also decreased by the linc-ITGB1 knockdown. These data suggest that linc-ITGB1 promotes breast cancer progression by inducing cell cycle arrest and interrupting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.'

aS'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA TUG1 correlates with poor prognosis and disease status in osteosarcoma.\r\nThe pathogenesis of osteosarcoma involves complex genetic and epigenetic factors. This study was to explore the impact and clinical relevance of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) on patients with osteosarcoma. Seventy-six osteosarcoma tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues were included for analysis. The plasma samples were obtained from 29 patients with osteosarcoma at pre-operation and post-operation, 42 at newly diagnosed, 18 who experienced disease progression or relapse, 45 post-treatment, 36 patients with benign bone tumor, and 20 healthy donors. Quantitative real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reactions were used to assess the correlation of the expression levels of TUG1 with clinical parameters of osteosarcoma patients. TUG1 was significantly overexpressed in the osteosarcoma tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) and was closely correlated with tumor size, post-operative chemotherapy, and Enneking surgical stage. Upregulation of TUG1 strongly correlated with poor prognosis and was an independent prognostic indicator for overall survival (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892.78, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.29-6.00, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.009) and progression-free survival (HR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.81, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.01-3.54, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.037). Our constructed nomogram containing TUG1 had more predictive accuracy than that without TUG1 (c-index 0.807 versus 0.776, respectively). In addition, for plasma samples, TUG1 expression levels were obviously decreased in post-operative patients (mean \xce\x94CT -4.98\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.22) compared with pre-operation patients (mean \xce\x94CT -6.09\xe2\x80\x89\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\x890.74), and the changes of TUG1 expression levels were significantly associated with disease status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that TUG1 could distinguish patients with osteosarcoma from healthy individuals compared with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (the area under curve 0.849 versus 0.544). TUG1 was overexpressed in patients with osteosarcoma and strongly correlated with disease status. In addition, TUG1 may serve as a molecular indicator in maintaining surveillance and forecasting prognosis.'

aS'Upregulated expression of long non-coding RNA LINC00982 regulates cell proliferation and its clinical relevance in patients with gastric cancer.\r\nEmerging evidences indicate that dysregulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in cancer tumorigenesis and progression and might be used as diagnosis and prognosis biomarker or potential therapeutic targets. Therefore, identification of cancer-associated lncRNAs and investigation of their biological functions and molecular mechanisms are important for understanding the development and progression of cancer. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA LINC00982, whose expression was downregulated in tumor tissues in 106 patients with gastric cancer (GC) compared with those in the adjacent normal tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). Furthermore, decreased LINC00982 expression was negatively correlated with invasion depth (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), advanced TNM stage (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.004), and regional lymph node metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.005). LINC00982 levels were robust in differentiating gastric cancer tissues from controls [area under the curve (AUC)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.742; 95\xc2\xa0% confidence interval (CI)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.678-0.800, P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01]. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that decreased LINC00982 expression contributed to poor overall survival (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) and disease-free survival (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) of patients. A multivariate survival analysis also indicated that LINC00982 could be an independent prognostic marker. The levels of LINC00982 in gastric juice from gastric patients were significantly lower than those from normal subjects (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.026). Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00982 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) could promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, while ectopic expression of LINC00982 inhibited cell proliferation and rendered cell cycle arrest in GC cells partly via regulating P15 and P16 protein expressions. Our findings present that decreased lncRNA LINC00982 could be identified as a poor prognostic biomarker in GC and regulate cell proliferation.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA Hotair mediated angiogenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by direct and indirect signaling pathways.\r\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), as a unique head and neck cancer type, is particularly prevalent in certain geographic areas such as eastern Asia. Until now, the therapeutic options have been restricted mainly to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. However, the clinical treatment effect remains unsatisfactory even if the combined radio-chemotherapies. Therefore, it is urgently needed to develop effective novel therapies against NPC. In this study, we discovered that lncRNA Hotair was extremely abundant in NPC cells and clinical NPC samples. Further studies showed that Hotair knockdown significantly attenuated both in vitro and in vivo tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. Our study also demonstrated that Hotair promoted angiogenesis through directly activating the transcription of angiogenic factor VEGFA as well as through GRP78-mediated upregulation of VEGFA and Ang2 expression. Therefore, Hotair may serve as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for NPC patients.'

aS'Low expression of long noncoding XLOC_010588 indicates a poor prognosis and promotes proliferation through upregulation of c-Myc in cervical cancer.\r\nOBJECTIVE: The identification and investigation of cancer-associated long non-coding RNAs are important for understanding the molecular biology of cancer. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression pattern of lncRNA XLOC_010588 in cervical cancer and to evaluate its biological role and clinical significance in tumor progression.METHODS: We examined the expression of XLOC_010588 in 218 cervical cancer tissues and matched 218 adjacent normal tissues using real-time qRT-PCR. Over-expression and RNA interference approaches were used to investigate the biological functions of XLOC_010588. The effect of XLOC_010588 on proliferation was evaluated by MTT and BrdU assays. Western blot assays were used to investigate the molecular mechanism by which XLOC_010588 increases cervical cancer cell proliferation.RESULTS: The results showed that XLOC_010588 expression in cervical cancer was significantly downregulated. Decreased XLOC_010588 expression was correlated with FIGO stage, tumor size and SCC-Ag. Moreover, cervical cancer patients with XLOC_010588 lower expression have shown poorer prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that XLOC_010588 expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival. Ectopic expression of XLOC_010588 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and SiHa cells. By contrast, knockdown of XLOC_010588 promoted the growth of HCC94 cells. Western blot assays confirmed that XLOC_010588 physically associates with c-Myc, consequently decreasing the expression of c-Myc. The expression of XLOC_010588 and c-Myc is strongly correlated in cervical cancer tissues.CONCLUSION: These results suggested that XLOC_010588 plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer cell proliferation via decreasing c-Myc expression and implicated the potential application of XLOC_010588 in cervical cancer therapy.'

aS'The has-miR-526b binding-site rs8506G&gt;a polymorphism in the lincRNA-NR_024015 exon identified by GWASs predispose to non-cardia gastric cancer risk.\r\nGastric cancer including the cardia and non-cardia types is the second frequent cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. A subset of non-cardia gastric cancer genetic susceptibility loci have been addressed among Asian through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). This study was to evaluate the effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) on non-cardia gastric cancer susceptibility in Chinese populations. We selected long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) located in non-cardia gastric cancer risk-related loci and identified 10 SNPs located within lincRNA exonic regions. We examined whether genetic polymorphisms in lincRNAs exons are associated with non-cardia gastric cancer risk in 438 non-cardia gastric cancer patients and 727 control subjects in Chinese populations using logistic regression. Functional relevance was further examined by biochemical assays. We found that lincRNA-NR_024015 rs8506AA carrier was significantly associated with risk of non-cardia gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR]\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.56, 95%CI\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.03-2.39, compared with the rs8506 AG or GG genotype. Further stratification analysis showed that the risk effect was more pronounced in subgroups of smokers (P\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a0.001). Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the G to A base change at rs8506G&gt;A disrupts the binding site for has-miR-526b, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of lincRNA-NR_024015 and affecting cell proliferation. Our present study established a robust association between the rs8506G&gt;A polymorphism in the lincRNA-NR_024015 exon and the risk of non-cardia gastric cancer.'

aS'A polymorphism rs12325489C&gt;T in the lincRNA-ENST00000515084 exon was found to modulate breast cancer risk via GWAS-based association analyses.\r\nBreast cancer, one of the most common malignancies diagnosed among women worldwide, is a complex polygenic disease in the etiology of which genetic factors play an important role. Thus far, a subset of breast cancer genetic susceptibility loci has been addressed among Asian woman through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). In this study, we identified numerous long, intergenic, noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) enriched in these breast cancer risk-related loci and identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within the sequences of lincRNA exonic regions. We examined whether these 16 SNPs are associated with breast cancer risk in 2539 cancer patients and 2818 control subjects from eastern, southern, and northern Chinese populations. We found that the C allele of the rs12325489C&gt;T polymorphism in the exonic regions of lincRNA-ENST00000515084 was associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR]\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.50-2.12), compared with the rs12325489TT genotype. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the C to T base change at rs12325489C&gt;T disrupts the binding site for miRNA-370, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of lincRNA-ENST00000515084 in vitro and in vivo, and affecting cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our findings indicate that the rs12325489C&gt;T polymorphism in the lincRNA-ENST00000515084 exon may be a genetic modifier in the development of breast cancer.'

aS'Single-Molecule Sequencing Reveals Estrogen-Regulated Clinically Relevant lncRNAs in Breast Cancer.\r\nEstrogen receptor (ER)\xce\xb1-positive tumors are commonly treated with ER\xce\xb1 antagonists or inhibitors of estrogen synthesis, but most tumors develop resistance, and we need to better understand the pathways that underlie the proliferative and tumorigenic role of this estrogen-activated transcription factor. We here present the first single-molecule sequencing of the estradiol-induced ER\xce\xb1 transcriptome in the luminal A-type human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D. Sequencing libraries were prepared from the polyadenylated RNA fraction after 8 hours of estrogen or vehicle treatment. Single-molecule sequencing was carried out in biological and technical replicates and differentially expressed genes were defined and analyzed for enriched processes. Correlation analysis with clinical expression and survival were performed, and follow-up experiments carried out using time series, chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real-time PCR. We uncovered that ER\xce\xb1 in addition to regulating approximately 2000 protein-coding genes, also regulated up to 1000 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Most of these were up-regulated, and 178 lncRNAs were regulated in both cell lines. We demonstrate that Long Intergenic Non-protein Coding RNA 1016 (LINC01016) and LINC00160 are direct transcriptional targets of ER\xce\xb1, correlate with ER\xce\xb1 expression in clinical samples, and show prognostic significance in relation to breast cancer survival. We show that silencing of LINC00160 results in reduced proliferation, demonstrating that lncRNA expression have functional consequences. Our findings suggest that ER\xce\xb1 regulation of lncRNAs is clinically relevant and that their functions and potential use as biomarkers for endocrine response are important to explore.'

aS'Combined inhibition of EGFR and c-ABL suppresses the growth of triple-negative breast cancer growth through inhibition of HOTAIR.\r\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) does not express conventional therapeutic targets and is the only type of malignant breast cancer for which no designated FDA-approved targeted therapy is available. Although overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently found in TNBC, the therapeutic effect of EGFR inhibitors in TNBC has been underwhelming. Here we show that co-treatment with clinically validated inhibitors of c-ABL (imatinib) and EGFR (lapatinib) results in synergistic growth inhibition in TNBC cells. The dual treatment leads to synergistic repression of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOTAIR (HOX Antisense Intergenic RNA). HOTAIR has been known to induce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer. Depleting HOTAIR alone phenocopies the dual treatment in growth suppression. We show that expression of HOTAIR is regulated by \xce\xb2-catenin through a LEF1/TCF4-binding site. The dual treatment blocks nuclear expression of \xce\xb2-catenin and prevents its recruitment to the HOTAIR promoter. Consistently, forced expression of \xce\xb2-catenin rescued HOTAIR expression and cell viability in the presence of both drugs. Upregulation of HOTAIR is associated with TNBC in cell lines and a cohort of primary tumors. This study elucidates a previously unidentified mechanism in TNBC linking signaling with lncRNA regulation which may be exploited for therapeutic gain.'

aS'HOXD-AS1 is a novel lncRNA encoded in HOXD cluster and a marker of neuroblastoma progression revealed via integrative analysis of noncoding transcriptome.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) constitute a major, but poorly characterized part of human transcriptome. Recent evidence indicates that many lncRNAs are involved in cancer and can be used as predictive and prognostic biomarkers. Significant fraction of lncRNAs is represented on widely used microarray platforms, however they have usually been ignored in cancer studies.RESULTS: We developed a computational pipeline to annotate lncRNAs on popular Affymetrix U133 microarrays, creating a resource allowing measurement of expression of 1581 lncRNAs. This resource can be utilized to interrogate existing microarray datasets for various lncRNA studies. We found that these lncRNAs fall into three distinct classes according to their statistical distribution by length. Remarkably, these three classes of lncRNAs were co-localized with protein coding genes exhibiting distinct gene ontology groups. This annotation was applied to microarray analysis which identified a 159 lncRNA signature that discriminates between localized and metastatic stages of neuroblastoma. Analysis of an independent patient cohort revealed that this signature differentiates also relapsing from non-relapsing primary tumors. This is the first example of the signature developed via the analysis of expression of lncRNAs solely. One of these lncRNAs, termed HOXD-AS1, is encoded in HOXD cluster. HOXD-AS1 is evolutionary conserved among hominids and has all bona fide features of a gene. Studying retinoid acid (RA) response of SH-SY5Y cell line, a model of human metastatic neuroblastoma, we found that HOXD-AS1 is a subject to morphogenic regulation, is activated by PI3K/Akt pathway and itself is involved in control of RA-induced cell differentiation. Knock-down experiments revealed that HOXD-AS1 controls expression levels of clinically significant protein-coding genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation, the hallmarks of metastatic cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings greatly extend the number of noncoding RNAs functionally implicated in tumor development and patient treatment and highlight their role as potential prognostic biomarkers of neuroblastomas.'

aS'Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs in cumulus cells isolated from PCOS patients.\r\nPURPOSE: To describe the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiles in cumulus cells isolated from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients by employing a microarray and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. This information will help us understand the occurrence and development of PCOS.METHODS: In this study, we used a microarray to describe lncRNA profiles in cumulus cells isolated from ten patients (five PCOS and five normal women). Several differentially expressed lncRNAs were chosen to validate the microarray results by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Then, the differentially expressed lncRNAs were classified into three subgroups (HOX loci lncRNA, enhancer-like lncRNA, and lincRNA) to deduce their potential features. Furthermore, a lncRNA/mRNA co-expression network was constructed by using the Cytoscape software (V2.8.3, http://www.cytoscape.org/ ).RESULTS: We observed that 623 lncRNAs and 260 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were significantly up- or down-regulated (\xe2\x89\xa52-fold change), and these differences could be used to discriminate cumulus cells of PCOS from those of normal patients. Five differentially expressed lncRNAs (XLOC_011402, ENST00000454271, ENST00000433673, ENST00000450294, and ENST00000432431) were selected to validate the microarray results using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the microarray data. Further analysis indicated that many differentially expressed lncRNAs were transcribed from chromosome 2 and may act as enhancers to regulate their neighboring protein-coding genes. Forty-three lncRNAs and 29 mRNAs were used to construct the coding-non-coding gene co-expression network. Most pairs positively correlated, and one mRNA correlated with one or more lncRNAs.CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to determine genome-wide lncRNA expression patterns in cumulus cells isolated from PCOS patients by microarray. The results show that clusters of lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in cumulus cells of PCOS patients compared with those of normal women, which revealed that lncRNAs differentially expressed in PCOS and normal women may contribute to the occurrence of PCOS and affect oocyte development.'

aS'Microarray profiling of bone marrow long non-coding RNA expression in Chinese pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients.\r\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays a role in gene transcription, protein expression and epigenetic regulation; and altered expression results in cancer development. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rare in children; and thus, this study profiled lncRNA expression in bone marrow samples from pediatric AML patients. Arraystar Human LncRNA Array V3.0 was used to profile differentially expressed lncRNAs in three bone marrow samples obtained from each pediatric AML patient and normal controls. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to confirm dysregulated lncRNA expressions in 22 AML bone marrow samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to construct the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network. A total of 372 dysregulated lncRNAs (difference \xe2\x89\xa510-fold) were found in pediatric AML patients compared to normal controls. Fifty-one mRNA levels were significantly upregulated, while 85 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated by &gt;10-fold in pediatric AML, compared to normal controls. GO terms and KEGG pathway annotation data revealed that cell cycle pathway-related genes were significantly associated with pediatric AML. As confirmed by qRT-PCR, expression of 24 of 97 lncRNA was altered in pediatric AML compared to normal controls. In pediatric AML, ENST00000435695 was the most upregulated lncRNA, while ENST00000415964 was the most downregulated lncRNA. Data from this study revealed dysregulated lncRNAs and mRNAs in pediatric AML versus normal controls that could form gene pathways to regulate cell cycle progression and immunoresponse. Further studies are required to determine whether these lncRNAs could serve as novel therapeutic targets and bbdiagnostic biomarkers in pediatric AML.'

aS'Increased New lncRNA-mRNA Gene Pair Levels in Human Cumulus Cells Correlate With Oocyte Maturation and Embryo Development.\r\nThe close relationship between cumulus cells and oocyte indicates that the analysis of cumulus gene expression is a potential noninvasive method to aid embryo selection and in vitro fertilization outcome. Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) could regulate essential pathways that contribute to human oocyte maturation, fertilization, and embryo development, which indicates that lncRNA would be valuable biomarkers. In our previous study, AK124742 is a newly detected lncRNA that was identified as being natural antisense to PSMD6, but its role in oocyte and embryo development is still not elucidated and needs to be investigated. Here, the expression of AK124742 and PSMD6 was measured in 40 pairs of cumulus cells from oocytes that result in high-quality embryos (HCCs) and from oocytes that result in poor-quality embryos (PCCs) by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The predictive value of AK124742 and PSMD6 was evaluated using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Notably, elevated expression levels of AK124742 and PSMD6 were observed in HCCs compared to PCCs (72.5% and 62.5%, respectively; P &lt; .01). Expression of AK124742 was potentially positively associated with the PSMD6 levels. The relative expression levels of AK124742 and PSMD6 in the pregnancy group were significantly higher than those in the nonpregnancy group (P &lt; .01).The area under the ROC curve of AK124742 was 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.93). In conclusion, AK124742 and PSMD6 as a new lncRNA-messenger RNA gene pair in human cumulus cells may be considered as potential biomarkers to aid embryo selection.'

aS'Effects of oestrogen on long noncoding RNA expression in oestrogen receptor alpha-positive ovarian cancer cells.\r\nAlthough oestrogen (E2) signalling has long been implicated in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) progression, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a major role in cancer progression; therefore, our aim was to explore whether any lncRNA is regulated by E2 and plays some potential roles in the hormonal regulation of EOC progression. Here, we reported that E2 significantly dysregulated 115 lncRNAs (fold change \xe2\x89\xa51.5, P&lt;0.05) in E2 receptor (ER) alpha (ER\xce\xb1)-positive EOC SKOV3 cells compared with E2-untreated controls based on the microarray analysis. E2 regulation of the expression of 58 lncRNAs was bioinformatics predicted to be ER\xce\xb1-mediated; this was confirmed for two candidates. Both TC0101441 and TC0101686 were dysregulated by E2 in another ER\xce\xb1-positive PEO1 cells but not in ER\xce\xb1-negative A2780 cells. Additionally, the modulation of TC0101441 and TC0101686 expression by E2 was abrogated by the ER inhibitor ICI 182, 780 and short hairpin RNAs targeting ER\xce\xb1 (ER\xce\xb1-shRNA). Further study of the two lncRNA expression indicated that ER\xce\xb1-positive EOC tissues had lower expression of TC0101686 and higher expression of TC0101441 compared to ER\xce\xb1-negative tissues. Particularly, elevated TC0101441 expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis, showing a metastatic potential. Results of in vitro assays further confirmed the pro-metastatic effect of TC0101441 and revealed that knockdown of TC0101441 also impaired E2-induced EOC cell migration/invasion by at least partly, regulating MMP2 and MMP3. Together, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that E2 modulates lncRNA expression in ER\xce\xb1-positive EOC cells and that this regulation is sometimes ER\xce\xb1-mediated. Furthermore, our findings reveal that TC0101441contributes to E2-induced EOC cell migration/invasion. These results may shed a new insight into estrogenic effect on EOC progression by providing a perspective of lncRNA.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA Fer-1-like protein 4 suppresses oncogenesis and exhibits prognostic value by associating with miR-106a-5p in colon cancer.\r\nNovel long non-coding RNA Fer-1-like protein 4 (FER1L4) has been confirmed to play crucial regulatory roles in tumor progression. It exerts an impact on tumor suppression and functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. However, its clinical significance in colon cancer is completely unknown. The aim of the present study was to annotate the role of FER1L4 and its clinical value in colon cancer. The results showed the aberrant expression of FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p in colon cancer tissues. In addition, significant negative correlation between FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p expression levels was observed. Among the colon cancer cell lines, FER1L4 levels were relatively lower, with concurrent high levels of miR-106a-5p. Restoration of FER1L4 decreased the expression of miR-106a-5p, and had a significant influence on colon cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The FER1L4 expression was correlated with depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion and clinical stage. Moreover, striking differences in overall survival and disease-free survival were observed for the cases with both low FER1L4 expression and high miR-106a-5p expression compared with cases with high FER1L4 expression and low miR-106a-5p expression. Circulating FER1L4 and miR-106a-5p levels were decreased and increased, respectively, in colon cancer patients after surgery. Our findings indicated that FER1L4 could exert a tumor suppressive impact on colon cancer, which at least, in part, through suppressing miR-106a-5p expression, and depletion of FER1L4, alone or combined with overexpression of miR-106a-5p, is predictive of poor prognosis in colon cancer and may play a crucial role in cancer prevention and treatment.'

aS'Expression quantitative trait loci in long non-coding RNA ZNRD1-AS1 influence both HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma development.\r\nZinc ribbon domain containing 1 (ZNRD1), cloned from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, may play integral roles in diverse processes including immune response against HBV infection and hepatocarcinogenesis. ZNRD1-AS1 (ZNRD1 antisense RNA 1) may be an important regulator of ZNRD1. By bioinformatics analyses, we identified that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZNRD1-AS1 may be expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for ZNRD1. In this study, we hypothesized that these eQTLs SNPs in ZNRD1-AS1 may influence both chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. We designed a case-control study of 1300 HBV-positive HCC patients, 1344 HBV persistent carriers and, 1344 HBV natural clearance subjects to test the associations of three ZNRD1 eQTLs SNPs (rs3757328, rs6940552 and, rs9261204) in ZNRD1-AS1 with the risk of both chronic HBV infection and HCC. Logistic regression analyses in additive genetic model showed that variant alleles of all the three SNPs increased host HCC risk, whereas variant allele of rs3757328 was associated with HBV clearance. Moreover, the haplotype containing variant alleles of the three SNPs was significantly associated with both HCC development (adjusted OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.18, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.01-1.38, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.035) and HBV clearance (adjusted OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.83, 95% CI\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.71-0.96, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.013), when compared with the most frequent haplotype. In vitro experiments showed that ZNRD1 knockdown inhibited the expression of HBV mRNA and promoted proliferation of HepG2.2.15 cells. These findings suggest that ZNRD1 regulatory SNPs may be susceptibility makers for risk of both chronic HBV infection and HCC.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA HOTTIP promotes tumor growth and inhibits cell apoptosis in lung cancer.\r\nLung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis is the best defense against this threat and is therefore of vital importance. In this study, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA HOTTIP in the tumor growth of lung cancer. Initially, we found that expression of HOTTIP was significantly elevated in 20 cases of lung cancer. HOTTIP was also differentially expressed in a consecutive of lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, specific shRNA against HOTTIP was employed to deplete expression of HOTTIP in A549 cells and NCI-H446 cells. After successfully depletion of HOTTIP, cell proliferation and colony formation were significantly inhibited in vitro. Tumor growth in vivo was also suppressed after depletion of HOTTIP in a mouse model of lung cancer. Moreover, depletion of HOTTIP caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and induced significant cell apoptosis. Cell cycle regulators Cdc25C, Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D1 were decreased upon depletion of HOTTIP. Pro-apoptotic factor Bad was up-regulated, whereas anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were down-regulated after HOTTIP ablation. These data suggest that lncRNA HOTTIP contributes to tumor growth in vivo and in vitro and inhibits cell apoptosis in lung cancer.'

aS'Microarray expression profile analysis of long non-coding RNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\r\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a variety of the human transcriptome that does not code for proteins and plays an important role in the development and progression of multiple solid malignant tumors. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of lncRNAs in three PDAC tumor samples (T) relative to those of matched adjacent non-tumor tissues (N) via a microarray with 30,586 lncRNA probes and 26,109 mRNA probes. The lncRNA microarray revealed 27,279 lncRNAs in PDAC samples, of which 2,331 were significantly upregulated (P&lt;0.05; T/N&gt;2.0) and 1,641 were downregulated (P&lt;0.05; N/T&gt;2.0) compared with matched adjacent non-tumor samples. In addition, 19,995 mRNAs were detected, of which 1,676 were significantly upregulated (P&lt;0.05; T/N&gt;2.0) and 1,981 were downregulated (P&lt;0.05; N/T&gt;2.0). Pathway analysis indicated that 41 pathways corresponded to upregulated transcripts and 25 pathways corresponded to downregulated transcripts (P-value cut-off is 0.05). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the highest enriched GOs targeted by upregulated and downregulated transcripts were tissue homeostasis. The validation results from quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and microarray analysis were consistent. Furthermore, the expression level of long intergenic non-coding RNA HOTAIRM1 was upregulated in 12 PDAC tissues samples compared with matched adjacent non-tumor samples by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles differed significantly between the PDAC tissues and their adjacent non-tumor tissues, and the revelation of an association between HOTAIRM1 expression and PDAC is especially noteworthy. These findings may provide new potential molecular markers for diagnosis and treatment of PDAC.'

aS'Identification of differentially expressed signatures of long non-coding RNAs associated with different metastatic potentials in gastric cancer.\r\nBACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) is known for its lymph node metastasis and outstanding morbidity and mortality. Thus, improvement in the current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism of GC is urgently needed to discover novel biomarkers involved in its progression and prognosis. Several long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in gastric tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the signature of lncRNA-associated metastasis in GC is not fully clarified.METHODS: We determined the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles correlating to GC with or without lymph node-metastasis based on microarray analysis. Twelve differentially expressed lncRNAs and six differentially expressed mRNAs were validated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay.RESULTS: The relationships between the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs XLOC_010235 or RP11-789C1.1 and lymph node metastasis, pathologic metastasis status, distal metastasis and TNM (tumour, node, and metastasis) stage were found to be significantly different. Via survival analysis, patients who had high-expressed XLOC_010235 or low-expressed RP11-789C1.1 showed significantly worse survival than patients with inverse-expressed XLOC_010235 or RP11-789C1.1.CONCLUSION: In summary, this current study highlights some evidence regarding the potential role of lncRNAs in GC and posits that specific lncRNAs can be identified as novel, poor prognostic biomarkers in GC.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA CCAT2 promotes breast tumor growth by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.\r\nIn addition to protein-coding genes, the human genome makes a large amount of noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs could have a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes such as cell growth and apoptosis as well as cancer progression and metastasis. The lncRNA CCAT2 is dysregulated in several cancers such as colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and breast cancer; however, the contributions of CCAT2 to breast cancer remain largely unknown. In the current paper, we first confirmed the high expression level of CCAT2 in breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay, and we further analyzed the relationship between CCAT2 expression and clinical prognostic factors. Also, the biological function of CCAT2 was explored and the results showed silencing of CCAT2 could suppress cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Finally, our results revealed that the abnormal expression of CCAT2 could influence the Wnt signaling pathway. In conclusion, lncRNA CCAT2 might be considered as a novel molecule involved in breast cancer development, which provides a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.'

aS'Natural antisense transcripts associated with genes involved in eye development.\r\nNatural antisense transcripts (NATs) are a class of genes whose role in controlling gene expression is becoming more and more relevant. We describe the identification of eight novel mouse NATs associated with transcription factors (Pax6, Pax2, Six3, Six6, Otx2, Crx, Rax and Vax2) that play an important role in eye development and function. These newly identified NATs overlap with the mature processed mRNAs or with the primary unprocessed transcript of their corresponding sense genes, are predicted to represent either protein coding or non-coding RNAs and undergo extensive alternative splicing. Expression studies, by both RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, demonstrate that most of these NATs, similarly to their sense counterparts, display a specific or predominant expression in the retina, particularly at postnatal stages. We found a significant reduction of the expression levels of one of these NATs, Vax2OS (Vax2 opposite strand) in a mouse mutant carrying the inactivation of Vax2, the corresponding sense gene. In addition, we overexpressed another NAT, CrxOS, in mouse adult retina using adeno-associated viral vectors and we observed a significant decrease in the expression levels of the corresponding sense gene, Crx. These results suggest that these transcripts are functionally related to their sense counterparts and may play an important role in regulating the molecular mechanisms that underlie eye development and function in both physiological and pathological conditions.'

aS'Expression of long non-coding RNA ZEB1-AS1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its correlation with tumor progression and patient survival.\r\nBACKGROUND: LncRNA ZEB1-AS1 has been identified as a tumor oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to explore ZEB1-AS1 expression levels and evaluated its clinical significance in ESCC patients.METHODS: LNCRNA ZEB1-AS1 expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) in 87 pairs of ESCC specimens and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Then, the association of ZEB1-AS1 expression with clinicopathological factors or survival of ESCC patients were determined.RESULTS: LNCRNA ZEB1-AS1 was found up-regulated in ESCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Increased lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 expression was significantly associated with tumor grade, depth of invasion, and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ESCC patients with high ZEB1-AS1 expression had a poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that ZEB1-AS1 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor in patients with ESCC.CONCLUSION: These results indicated that lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 was associated with tumor progression and could be an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients.'

aS'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA HIF 1\xce\xb1-anti-sense 1 induced by transforming growth factor-\xce\xb2-mediated targeting of sirtuin 1 promotes osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells.\r\nThe present study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of long non-coding RNA hypoxia-inducible factor 1\xce\xb1-anti\xe2\x80\x91sense 1 (lncRNA HIF1\xce\xb1-AS1) in osteoblast differentiation as well as its targeting by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which may be inhibited by transforming growth factor (TGF)\xe2\x80\x91\xce\xb2 in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Real\xe2\x80\x91time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blot analysis, lncRNA PCR arrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed in order to examine the interference of SIRT1 expression by TGF\xe2\x80\x91\xce\xb2, the effects of SIRT1 overexpression on lncRNA HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1 and the regulation of the expression of homeobox (HOX)D10, which promotes BMSC differentiation, by lncRNA HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1. The results showed that TGF\xe2\x80\x91\xce\xb2 interfered with SIRT1 expression. Furthermore, lncRNA HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1 was significantly downregulated following overexpression of SIRT1. In addition, low expression of HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1 was sufficient to block the expression of HOXD10. The present study further demonstrated that downregulation of HOXD10 by HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1 interfered with acetylation, and subsequently resulted in the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. These results suggested that HIF1\xce\xb1\xe2\x80\x91AS1 is an essential mediator of osteoblast differentiation, and may thus represent a gene\xe2\x80\x91therapeutic agent for the treatment of human bone diseases.'

aS'A micropeptide encoded by a putative long noncoding RNA regulates muscle performance.\r\nFunctional micropeptides can be concealed within RNAs that appear to be noncoding. We discovered a conserved micropeptide, which we named myoregulin (MLN), encoded by a skeletal muscle-specific RNA annotated as a putative long noncoding RNA. MLN shares structural and functional similarity with phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which inhibit SERCA, the membrane pump that controls muscle relaxation by regulating Ca(2+) uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). MLN interacts directly with SERCA and impedes Ca(2+) uptake into the SR. In contrast to PLN and SLN, which are expressed in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle in mice, MLN is robustly expressed in all skeletal muscle. Genetic deletion of MLN in mice enhances Ca(2+) handling in skeletal muscle and improves exercise performance. These findings identify MLN as an important regulator of skeletal muscle physiology and highlight the possibility that additional micropeptides are encoded in the many RNAs currently annotated as noncoding.'

aS'lincRNAs act in the circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation.\r\nAlthough thousands of large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been identified in mammals, few have been functionally characterized, leading to debate about their biological role. To address this, we performed loss-of-function studies on most lincRNAs expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and characterized the effects on gene expression. Here we show that knockdown of lincRNAs has major consequences on gene expression patterns, comparable to knockdown of well-known ES cell regulators. Notably, lincRNAs primarily affect gene expression in trans. Knockdown of dozens of lincRNAs causes either exit from the pluripotent state or upregulation of lineage commitment programs. We integrate lincRNAs into the molecular circuitry of ES cells and show that lincRNA genes are regulated by key transcription factors and that lincRNA transcripts bind to multiple chromatin regulatory proteins to affect shared gene expression programs. Together, the results demonstrate that lincRNAs have key roles in the circuitry controlling ES cell state.'

aS'LncRNA expression profile reveals the potential role of lncRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis.\r\nGastric cancer ranks the second highest death rate and is the highest morbidity digestive system malignancy in China. Few reports have elucidated the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the gastric cancer pathogenesis. The present study was aimed to identify aberrantly expressed lncRNAs involved in the progression of gastric cancer and explored their potential functions. A total of 1,297 lncRNAs and 2,037 mRNAs that showed significantly differential expression level between gastric tumor samples and matched adjacent normal tissues were identified in six pairs of samples using microarray assay. To further explore their functions, lncRNAs were classified into different subgroups and mRNAs were clustered into several pathways. The expression level of 4 lncRNAs: UCA1, lincRNA-BBOX1-2, CR594506 and BC015134 were further confirmed in another cohort of 10 gastric patients by real-time PCR assay. A coding-non-coding co-expression network revealed that the four validated lncRNAs were correlated with twenty-six mRNAs which gave clues about the potential roles of these lncRNAs in the process of gastric cancer progression.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA BANCR promotes proliferation and migration of lung carcinoma via MAPK pathways.\r\nLung carcinoma (LC) is one of the most mortal malignant tumors, and is becoming one of most lethal threat to human health and life. LncRNAs, emerging non-coding RNAs but poorly understood, are involved in the proliferation, metastasis, infiltration and apoptosis of LC. In this study, an lncRNA BANCR in LC cells was chosen to investigate the effect on LC cells, and clarify the possible mechanism. The results showed that BANCR levels were downregulated in LC cells. When BANCR expression was improved by tranfection with pcDNA-BANCR vector, tumor growth was suppressed. Vise versa, when BANCR was knockdown by si-BANCR, cell proliferation and migration of LC were remarkably promoted. We further found that MAPK pathways were involved in the BANCR-mediated cell proliferation and migration of LC. Moreover, BANCR was found to regulate LC proliferation and migration via not ERK MAPK, but p38 MAPK and JNK inactivations. These findings not only suggested that BANCR may be a new target for LC chemotherapy in future, but also will help us to fully understand the oncogenesis of LC.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA TSIX is upregulated in scleroderma dermal fibroblasts and controls collagen mRNA stabilization.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to have various functions other than RNA silencing. We tried to evaluate the expression of lncRNAs in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and determined whether lncRNAs controls collagen expression in dermal fibroblasts. lncRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. Protein and mRNA levels of collagen were analysed using immunoblotting and real-time PCR. We found TSIX, one of the lncRNAs, was overexpressed in SSc dermal fibroblasts both in vivo and in vitro, which was inhibited by the transfection of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\xce\xb21 siRNA. TSIX siRNA reduced the mRNA expression of type I collagen in normal and SSc dermal fibroblasts, but not the levels of major disease-related cytokines. In addition, TSIX siRNA significantly reduced type I collagen mRNA stability, but not protein half-lives. Furthermore, we first investigated serum lncRNA levels in patients with SSc, and serum TSIX levels were significantly increased in SSc patients. TSIX is a new regulator of collagen expression which stabilizes the collagen mRNA. The upregulation of TSIX seen in SSc fibroblasts may result from activated endogenous TGF-\xce\xb2 signalling and may play a role in the constitutive upregulation of collagen in these cells. Further studies on the regulatory mechanism of tissue fibrosis by lncRNAs in SSc skin lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis, new diagnostic methods by their serum levels and new therapeutic approaches using siRNAs.'

aS'Cancer Specific Long Noncoding RNAs Show Differential Expression Patterns and Competing Endogenous RNA Potential in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression by acting with microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the roles of cancer specific lncRNA and its related competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network in hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) are not fully understood. The lncRNA profiles in 372 HCC patients, including 372 tumor and 48 adjacent non-tumor liver tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and NCBI GEO omnibus (GSE65485) were analyzed. Cancer specific lncRNAs (or HCC related lncRNAs) were identified and correlated with clinical features. Based on bioinformatics generated from miRcode, starBase, and miRTarBase, we constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network (ceRNA network) in HCC. We found 177 cancer specific lncRNAs in HCC (fold change \xe2\x89\xa5 1.5, P &lt; 0.01), 41 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade, AJCC tumor stage, and AJCC TNM staging system. Six lncRNAs (CECR7, LINC00346, MAPKAPK5-AS1, LOC338651, FLJ90757, and LOC283663) were found to be significantly associated with overall survival (OS, log-rank P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, our results showed the lncRNA expression patterns and a complex ceRNA network in HCC, and identified a complex cancer specific ceRNA network, which includes 14 lncRNAs and 17 miRNAs in HCC.'

aS"A long noncoding RNA perturbs the circadian rhythm of hepatoma cells to facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis.\r\nClock circadian regulator (CLOCK)/brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (BMAL1) complex governs the regulation of circadian rhythm through triggering periodic alterations of gene expression. However, the underlying mechanism of circadian clock disruption in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC), contributes to the perturbations in circadian rhythm of hepatoma cells. Our observations showed that HULC was able to heighten the expression levels of CLOCK and its downstream circadian oscillators, such as period circadian clock 1 and cryptochrome circadian clock 1, in hepatoma cells. Strikingly, HULC altered the expression pattern and prolonged the periodic expression of CLOCK in hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, the complementary base pairing between HULC and the 5' untranslated region of CLOCK mRNA underlay the HULC-modulated expression of CLOCK, and the mutants in the complementary region failed to achieve the event. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated that the levels of CLOCK were elevated in HCC tissues, and the expression levels of HULC were positively associated with those of CLOCK in clinical HCC samples. In functional experiments, our data exhibited that CLOCK was implicated in the HULC-accelerated proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data show that an lncRNA, HULC, is responsible for the perturbations in circadian rhythm through upregulating circadian oscillator CLOCK in hepatoma cells, resulting in the promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which lncRNA accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis through disturbing circadian rhythm of HCC."

aS'The risk-associated long noncoding RNA NBAT-1 controls neuroblastoma progression by regulating cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation.\r\nNeuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system and the most common extracranial tumor of childhood. By sequencing transcriptomes of low- and high-risk neuroblastomas, we detected differentially expressed annotated and nonannotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We identified a lncRNA neuroblastoma associated transcript-1 (NBAT-1) as a biomarker significantly predicting clinical outcome of neuroblastoma. CpG methylation and a high-risk neuroblastoma associated SNP on chromosome 6p22 functionally contribute to NBAT-1 differential expression. Loss of NBAT-1 increases cellular proliferation and invasion. It controls these processes via epigenetic silencing of target genes. NBAT-1 loss affects neuronal differentiation through activation of the neuronal-specific transcription factor NRSF/REST. Thus, loss of NBAT-1 contributes to aggressive neuroblastoma by increasing proliferation and impairing differentiation of neuronal precursors.'

aS'The lncRNA MIR31HG regulates p16(INK4A) expression to modulate senescence.\r\nOncogene-induced senescence (OIS) can occur in response to oncogenic insults and is considered an important tumour suppressor mechanism. Here we identify the lncRNA MIR31HG as upregulated in OIS and find that knockdown of MIR31HG promotes a strong p16(INK4A)-dependent senescence phenotype. Under normal conditions, MIR31HG is found in both nucleus and cytoplasm, but following B-RAF expression MIR31HG is located mainly in the cytoplasm. We show that MIR31HG interacts with both INK4A and MIR31HG genomic regions and with Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, and that MIR31HG is required for PcG-mediated repression of the INK4A locus. We further identify a functional enhancer, located between MIR31HG and INK4A, which becomes activated during OIS and interacts with the MIR31HG promoter. Data from melanoma patients show a negative correlation between MIR31HG and p16(INK4A) expression levels, suggesting a role for this transcript in cancer. Hence, our data provide a new lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for the tumour suppressor p16(INK4A).'

aS'The oestrogen receptor alpha-regulated lncRNA NEAT1 is a critical modulator of prostate cancer.\r\nThe androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in establishing an oncogenic cascade that drives prostate cancer progression. Some prostate cancers escape androgen dependence and are often associated with an aggressive phenotype. The oestrogen receptor alpha (ER\xce\xb1) is expressed in prostate cancers, independent of AR status. However, the role of ER\xce\xb1 remains elusive. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and RNA-sequencing data, we identified an ER\xce\xb1-specific non-coding transcriptome signature. Among putatively ER\xce\xb1-regulated intergenic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), we identified nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) as the most significantly overexpressed lncRNA in prostate cancer. Analysis of two large clinical cohorts also revealed that NEAT1 expression is associated with prostate cancer progression. Prostate cancer cells expressing high levels of NEAT1 were recalcitrant to androgen or AR antagonists. Finally, we provide evidence that NEAT1 drives oncogenic growth by altering the epigenetic landscape of target gene promoters to favour transcription.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA expression profiles of hepatitis C virus-related dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma.\r\nRecently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be implicated in cancer progression. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to Hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized lncRNA expression in 73 tissue samples from several different developmental stages of HCV-related hepatocarcinogenesis by repurposing microarray data sets. We found that the expression of 7 lncRNAs in preneoplastic lesions and HCC was significantly different. Among these significantly differently expressed lncRNAs, the lncRNA LINC01419 transcripts were expressed at higher levels in early stage HCC compared to dysplasia and as compared with early stage HCC, lncRNA AK021443 level increase in advanced stage HCC while lncRNA AF070632 level decrease in advanced stage HCC. Using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR, we validated that LINC01419 was significantly overexpressed in HBV-related and HCV-related HCC when compared with matched non-tumor liver tissues. Moreover, functional predictions suggested that LINC01419 and AK021443 regulate cell cycle genes, whereas AF070632 is associated with cofactor binding, oxidation-reduction and carboxylic acid catabolic process. These findings provide the first large-scale survey of lncRNAs associated with the development of hepatocarcinogenesis and may offer new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCV-related HCC.'

aS'LncRNA-AP001631.9 promotes cell migration in gastric cancer.\r\nRecently, an increasing number of reports have revealed that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) play important roles in a variety of aspects of cell activity, and their aberrant expression is closely associated with multigenetic diseases, including carcinoma. In the present study, through microarray analysis, we screened out a new LncRNA (LncRNA-AP001631.9), which was regulated by FOXM1, a well-known carcinogenetic factor and aimed to reveal the functional roles of this novel LncRNA in gastric cancer development. The data from qRT-PCR confirmed that the expression level of LncRNA-AP001631.9 was positively correlated with that of FOXM1. The transwell and wound healing assays indicated that LncRNA-AP001631.9 was required for the migration of gastric cancer cells. The downregulation of LncRNA-AP001631.9 by small interference RNA suppressed the migratory ability of MGC803 and AGS cells, while the overexpression of LncRNA-AP001631.9 promoted the movement of BGC823 and SGC7901 cells. Furthermore, a tail vein injection was administered, and the obtained results suggested that LncRNA-AP001631.9 contributed to the distant metastasis of SGC7901 cells. Moreover, we also collected 36 paired samples of gastric cancer tissues to explore the expression levels of LncRNA-AP001631.9. The qRT-PCR data indicated that the LncRNA-AP001631.9 expression was frequently increased in gastric cancer tissues. Taken together, our findings established that LncRNA-AP001631.9 plays critical roles in gastric cancer progression and can serve as a potential new target for the treatment of gastric cancer.'

aS'A novel antisense long noncoding RNA within the IGF1R gene locus is imprinted in hematopoietic malignancies.\r\nDysregulation of the insulin-like growth factor type I receptor (IGF1R) has been implicated in the progression and therapeutic resistance of malignancies. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, IGF1R is one of the most abundantly phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases, promoting cell growth through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF1R gene dysregulation in cancer. We discovered a novel intragenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) within the IGF1R locus, named IRAIN, which is transcribed in an antisense direction from an intronic promoter. The IRAIN lncRNA was expressed exclusively from the paternal allele, with the maternal counterpart being silenced. Using both reverse transcription-associated trap and chromatin conformation capture assays, we demonstrate that this lncRNA interacts with chromatin DNA and is involved in the formation of an intrachromosomal enhancer/promoter loop. Knockdown of IRAIN lncRNA with shRNA abolishes this intrachromosomal interaction. In addition, IRAIN was downregulated both in leukemia cell lines and in blood obtained from high-risk AML patients. These data identify IRAIN as a new imprinted lncRNA that is involved in long-range DNA interactions.'

aS'LncRNAs expression signatures of renal clear cell carcinoma revealed by microarray.\r\nBACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes involved in a variety of biological functions. They are aberrantly expressed in many types of cancers. In this study, we described lncRNAs profiles in 6 pairs of human renal clear cell carcinoma (RCCC) and the corresponding adjacent nontumorous tissues (NT) by microarray.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: With abundant and varied probes accounting 33,045 LncRNAs in our microarray, the number of lncRNAs that expressed at a certain level could be detected is 17157. From the data we found there were thousands of lncRNAs that differentially expressed (\xe2\x89\xa5 2 fold-change) in RCCC tissues compared with NT and 916 lncRNAs differentially expressed in five or more of six RCCC samples. Compared with NT, many lncRNAs were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in RCCC. Our data showed that down-regulated lncRNAs were more common than up-regulated ones. ENST00000456816, X91348, BC029135, NR_024418 were evaluated by qPCR in sixty-three pairs of RCCC and NT samples. The four lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in RCCC compared with matched histologically normal renal tissues.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study is the first one to determine genome-wide lncRNAs expression patterns in RCCC by microarray. The results displayed that clusters of lncRNAs were aberrantly expressed in RCCC compared with NT samples, which revealed that lncRNAs differentially expressed in tumor tissues and normal tissues may exert a partial or key role in tumor development. Taken together, this study may provide potential targets for future treatment of RCCC and novel insights into cancer biology.'

aS'Transcriptome interrogation of human myometrium identifies differentially expressed sense-antisense pairs of protein-coding and long non-coding RNA genes in spontaneous labor at term.\r\nOBJECTIVE: To identify differentially expressed long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes in human myometrium in women with spontaneous labor at term.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Myometrium was obtained from women undergoing cesarean deliveries who were not in labor (n = 19) and women in spontaneous labor at term (n = 20). RNA was extracted and profiled using an Illumina\xc2\xae microarray platform. We have used computational approaches to bound the extent of long non-coding RNA representation on this platform, and to identify co-differentially expressed and correlated pairs of long non-coding RNA genes and protein-coding genes sharing the same genomic loci.RESULTS: We identified co-differential expression and correlation at two genomic loci that contain coding-lncRNA gene pairs: SOCS2-AK054607 and LMCD1-NR_024065 in women in spontaneous labor at term. This co-differential expression and correlation was validated by qRT-PCR, an experimental method completely independent of the microarray analysis. Intriguingly, one of the two lncRNA genes differentially expressed in term labor had a key genomic structure element, a splice site, that lacked evolutionary conservation beyond primates.CONCLUSIONS: We provide, for the first time, evidence for coordinated differential expression and correlation of cis-encoded antisense lncRNAs and protein-coding genes with known as well as novel roles in pregnancy in the myometrium of women in spontaneous labor at term.'

aS'Upregulated expression of long noncoding RNA SNHG15 promotes cell proliferation and invasion through regulates MMP2/MMP9 in patients with GC.\r\nAccumulation of data indicates that misregulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in cancer tumorigenesis and progression and might be served as diagnosis and prognosis biomarker or potential therapeutic targets. Identification of cancer-associated lncRNAs and investigation of their biological functions and molecular mechanisms are significant for understanding the development and progression of cancer. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA SNHG15, whose expression was upregulated in tumor tissues in 106 patients with gastric cancer (GC) compared with those in the adjacent normal tissues (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001). Furthermore, increased SNHG15 expression was positively correlated with invasion depth (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.001), advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.001), and lymph node metastasis (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.019). SNHG15 levels were robust in differentiating GC tissues from controls (area under the curve (AUC)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.722; 95\xc2\xa0% confidence interval (CI)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.657-0.782, P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that elevated SNHG15 expression contributed to poor overall survival (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) and disease-free survival (P\xe2\x80\x89&lt;\xe2\x80\x890.01) of patients. A multivariate survival analysis also indicated that SNHG15 could be an independent prognostic marker. Furthermore, knockdown of SNHG15 expression by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation and invasion and induce apoptosis, while ectopic expression of SNHG15 promoted cell proliferation and invasion in GC cells partly via regulating MMP2 and MMP9 protein expression. Our findings present that elevated lncRNA SNHG15 could be identified as a poor prognostic biomarker in GC and regulate cell invasion.'

In previous years, with the application of high\xe2\x80\x91throughput sequencing, a large number of lncRNAs associated with virus infections have been identified and intensively investigated, however, there are few studies examining the association between lncRNAs and HCV replication. Previous studies have demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is activated by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and in turn increases the replication of HCV. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is only partially understood. In the present study, using human lncRNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays, it was identified that lnc\xe2\x80\x91IGF2\xe2\x80\x91AS, lnc\xe2\x80\x917SK, lnc\xe2\x80\x91SChLAP1 and lnc\xe2\x80\x91SRA1 are upregulated by STAT3. In addition, among these four lncRNAs, only lnc\xe2\x80\x91IGF2\xe2\x80\x91AS and lnc\xe2\x80\x917SK were involved in HCV replication. Transfection of siRNA lnc\xe2\x80\x917SK and siRNA lnc\xe2\x80\x91IGF2\xe2\x80\x91AS partially inhibited the replication of HCV in Huh7 cells. Data also indicated that when transfected with siRNA lnc\xe2\x80\x917SK and siRNA lnc\xe2\x80\x91IGF2\xe2\x80\x91AS, the expression of phosphatidylinositol 4\xe2\x80\x91phosphate (PI4P), which was identified to be associated with HCV replication, was reduced. Thus, the present study identified two new types of lncRNAs, lnc\xe2\x80\x91IGF2\xe2\x80\x91AS and lnc\xe2\x80\x917SK, which can be upregulated by STAT3 and are involved in HCV replication by regulating PI4P.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA CASC2 suppresses malignancy in human gliomas by miR-21.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in many diseases including cancer. LncRNA CASC2 (cancer susceptibility candidate 2) has been characterized as a tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer. However, the role and function of CASC2 in human gliomas remain unknown. In this study, we confirmed that CASC2 was lowly expressed in glioma tissues as well as in U251 and U87 glioma cell lines. Overexpression of CASC2 inhibited the malignancy of glioma cells, including proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) has been reported to be overexpressed in human glioma tissues and cell lines, which is responsible for the malignant progression of glioma. We found that up-regulated CASC2 decreased the expression of miR-21 significantly and there is a reciprocal repression between CASC2 and miR-21 in an Argonaute2-dependent manner. Furthermore, bioinformatics, luciferase reporter assays and pull-down assay confirmed that miR-21 binds to CASC2 in a sequence-specific manner. Introduction of miR-21 largely abrogated CASC2-mediated inhibition of glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promotion of cell apoptosis. This study demonstrated that CASC2 plays a tumor suppressive role in glioma via negative regulation of miR-21, which may be a novel therapeutic target for treating gliomas.'

aS'Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus: a database of phenotype-specific transcriptome profiling in cancer cells.\r\nThe genome-wide transcriptome profiling of cancerous and normal tissue samples can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression. RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a revolutionary tool that has been used extensively in cancer research. However, no existing RNA-Seq database provides all of the following features: (i) large-scale and comprehensive data archives and analyses, including coding-transcript profiling, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling and coexpression networks; (ii) phenotype-oriented data organization and searching and (iii) the visualization of expression profiles, differential expression and regulatory networks. We have constructed the first public database that meets these criteria, the Cancer RNA-Seq Nexus (CRN, http://syslab4.nchu.edu.tw/CRN). CRN has a user-friendly web interface designed to facilitate cancer research and personalized medicine. It is an open resource for intuitive data exploration, providing coding-transcript/lncRNA expression profiles to support researchers generating new hypotheses in cancer research and personalized medicine.'

aS'Overexpression of the LSAMP and TUSC7 genes in acute myeloid leukemia following microdeletion/duplication of chromosome 3.\r\nThe 3q13.31 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by developmental delay, postnatal growth above the mean, characteristic facial features, and abnormal male genitalia. Moreover, a frequent deletion in the 3q13.31 chromosome region has been identified in patients who are affected by osteosarcomas. Among the genes located within the deleted region, the involvement of the limbic system-associated membrane protein gene (LSAMP), together with a non-coding RNA tumor suppressor candidate 7 gene (TUSC7), has been suggested. We describe the case of an adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with a novel chromosomal rearrangement characterized by a 3q13.31 microdeletion and an extra copy of the 3q13.31-q29 chromosomal region translocated to the long arm of the Y chromosome. This karyotypic aberration seems to cause LSAMP and TUSC7 gene expression dysregulation. In conclusion, we report the first case of LSAMP and TUSC7 gene overexpression, possibly due to a position effect in an AML patient bearing a 3q13.31 cryptic deletion.'

aS"Genomic imprinting at the WT1 gene involves a novel coding transcript (AWT1) that shows deregulation in Wilms' tumours.\r\nThe Wilms' tumour suppressor gene, WT1, is mutated in 10-15% of Wilms' tumours and encodes zinc-finger proteins with diverse cellular functions critical for nephrogenesis, genitourinary development, haematopoiesis and sex determination. Here we report that a novel alternative WT1 transcript, AWT1, is co-expressed with WT1 in renal and haematopoietic cells. AWT1 maintains WT1 exonic structure between exons 2 and 10, but deploys a new 5'-exon located in intron 1 of WT1. The AWT1 gene predicts proteins of approximately 33 kDa, comprising all exon 5 and exon 9 splicing variants previously characterized for WT1. Although WT1 is not genomically imprinted in kidney, we have previously shown monoallelic expression of a WT1 antisense transcript (WT1-AS) that is consistent with genomic imprinting. Here we demonstrate that both WT1-AS and the novel AWT1 transcript are imprinted in normal kidney with expression confined to the paternal allele. Wilms' tumours display biallelic AWT1 expression, indicating relaxation of imprinting of AWT1 in a subset of WTs. Our findings define human chromosome 11p13 as a new imprinted locus, and also suggest a possible molecular basis for the strong bias of paternal allele mutations and variable penetrance observed in syndromes with inherited WT1 mutations."

aS'Systematic gene microarray analysis of the lncRNA expression profiles in human uterine cervix carcinoma.\r\nThe human uterine cervix carcinoma is one of the most well-known malignancy reproductive system cancers, which threatens women health globally. However, the mechanisms of the oncogenesis and development process of cervix carcinoma are not yet fully understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proved to play key roles in various biological processes, especially development of cancer. The function and mechanism of lncRNAs on cervix carcinoma is still rarely reported. We selected 3 cervix cancer and normal cervix tissues separately, then performed lncRNA microarray to detect the differentially expressed lncRNAs. Subsequently, we explored the potential function of these dysregulated lncRNAs through online bioinformatics databases. Finally, quantity real-time PCR was carried out to confirm the expression levels of these dysregulated lncRNAs in cervix cancer and normal tissues. We uncovered the profiles of differentially expressed lncRNAs between normal and cervix carcinoma tissues by using the microarray techniques, and found 1622 upregulated and 3026 downregulated lncRNAs (fold-change&gt;2.0) in cervix carcinoma compared to the normal cervical tissue. Furthermore, we found HOXA11-AS might participate in cervix carcinogenesis by regulating HOXA11, which is involved in regulating biological processes of cervix cancer. This study afforded expression profiles of lncRNAs between cervix carcinoma tissue and normal cervical tissue, which could provide database for further research about the function and mechanism of key-lncRNAs in cervix carcinoma, and might be helpful to explore potential diagnosis factors and therapeutic targets for cervix carcinoma.'

aS"Evolutionary conservation and tissue-specific processing of Hoxa 11 antisense transcripts.\r\nWe previously described the existence of abundant, processed, polyadenylated murine Hoxa 11 antisense transcripts. Of particular interest, in the developing limbs the antisense transcripts were observed to be present in a pattern complementary to that of the sense transcripts, suggesting a possible regulatory function (Hsieh-Li et al. 1995). We have analyzed the human HOXA 11 genomic locus, showing strong evolutionary conservation of regions potentially encoding antisense transcripts. Human HOXA 11 fetal kidney antisense cDNAs were identified and sequenced, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of Hoxa 11 antisense transcription. As for the mouse, the human antisense RNAs were polyadenylated and showed several alternative processing patterns, but shared the sequences of a common 3' exon. The evolutionary conservation of the opposite strand transcripts strongly suggests function. A significantly long open reading frame was observed, but mouse-human comparisons argued against true coding function. Murine kidney Hoxa 11 antisense transcription and processing was also examined, revealing tissue-specific differences between limb and kidney. A novel procedure, designated Race in Circles, was devised and used to define mouse limb antisense transcription start sites. Furthermore, comparisons of human, mouse, and chicken sense transcript Hoxa 11 homeobox nucleotide sequences and their respective encoded homeodomains indicate a very strong selective pressure in vertebrates against mutations that result in coding changes. Given the significant differences in amino acid sequences of the homeodomains of different Hox genes, this observation argues for individual homeodomain functional specificity."

aS'A facilitated tracking and transcription mechanism of long-range enhancer function.\r\nIn the human epsilon-globin gene locus, the HS2 enhancer in the Locus Control Region regulates transcription of the embryonic epsilon-globin gene located over 10 kb away. The mechanism of long-range HS2 enhancer function was not fully established. Here we show that the HS2 enhancer complex containing the enhancer DNA together with RNA polymerase II (pol II) and TBP tracks along the intervening DNA, synthesizing short, polyadenylated, intergenic RNAs to ultimately loop with the epsilon-globin promoter. Guided by this facilitated tracking and transcription mechanism, the HS2 enhancer delivers pol II and TBP to the cis-linked globin promoter to activate mRNA synthesis from the target gene. An insulator inserted in the intervening DNA between the enhancer and the promoter traps the enhancer DNA and the associated pol II and TBP at the insulator site, blocking mid-stream the facilitated tracking and transcription mechanism of the enhancer complex, thereby blocking long-range enhancer function.'

aS"7SK small nuclear RNA inhibits cancer cell proliferation through apoptosis induction.\r\n7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is a 331-333-bp non-coding RNA, which recruits HEXIM 1/2 protein to inhibit positive elongation factor b (P-TEFb) activity. P-TEFb is an essential factor in alleviating promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and initiating the productive elongation phase of gene transcription. Without this protein, Pol II will remain in its hypophosphorylated state, and no transcription occurs. In this study, we inhibited P-TEFb activity by over-expressing 7SK snRNA in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cancer cell line. This inhibition led to a significant decrease in cell viability, which can be due to the transcription inhibition. Moreover, 7SK snRNA over-expression promoted apoptosis in cancerous cells. Our results suggest 7SK snRNA as a potential endogenous anti-cancer agent, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a long non-coding RNA's over-expression against cancer cell growth and proliferation."

aS'Evaluation of four genetic variants in han chinese subjects with high myopia.\r\nHigh myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. However, the exact etiology of high myopia remains unraveled despite numerous attempts of elucidation. Previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) has revealed that four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs2969180, rs1652333, rs9307551, and rs7837791, were associated with high myopia in Caucasians. The present study was conducted to investigate whether these genetic variants were associated with high myopia in Han Chinese. These four SNPs were genotyped by SNaPshot method in a Han Chinese cohort composed of 827 patients with high myopia and 988 healthy controls. Among the SNPs genotyped, only rs9307551 was found to be significantly associated with high myopia in this study. Carriers of rs9307551A allele, AA, and AC genotypes had an increased risk of high myopia (OR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.14-1.54; OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.28-2.38; OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.01, resp.). Interestingly, when split by gender, the association between rs9307551 and high myopia proved to be gender-specific with significance observed only in females but not males. These findings suggested that the SNP of rs9307551 showed a gender-specific association with high myopia in the Han Chinese population. In addition, LOC100506035, a lincRNA gene, might play a crucial role in the susceptibility to high myopia.'

aS'Reversibility and heritability of liver fibrosis: Implications for research and therapy.\r\nLiver fibrosis continues to be a major health problem worldwide due to lack of effective therapy. If the etiology cannot be eliminated, liver fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis and eventually to liver failure or malignancy; both are associated with a fatal outcome. Liver transplantation, the only curative therapy, is still mostly unavailable. Liver fibrosis was shown to be a reversible process; however, complete reversibility remains debatable. Recently, the molecular markers of liver fibrosis were shown to be transmitted across generations. Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications and noncoding RNA have emerged as major determinants of gene expression during liver fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Furthermore, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to be transmitted through mitosis and meiosis to daughter cells and subsequent generations. However, the exact epigenetic regulation of complete liver fibrosis resolution and inheritance has not been fully elucidated. This communication will highlight the recent advances in the search for delineating the mechanisms governing resolution of liver fibrosis and the potential for multigenerational and transgenerational transmission of fibrosis markers. The fact that epigenetic changes, unlike genetic mutations, are reversible and can be modulated pharmacologically underscores the unique opportunity to develop effective therapy to completely reverse liver fibrosis, to prevent the development of malignancy and to regulate heritability of fibrosis phenotype.'

aS'Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.\r\nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is one of the primary causes of severe pulmonary hypertension. In order to identify long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may be involved in the development of CTEPH, comprehensive lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling of endothelial tissues from the pulmonary arteries of CTEPH patients was conducted with microarray analysis. Differential expression of 185 lncRNAs was observed in the CTEPH tissues compared with healthy control tissues. Further analysis identified 464 regulated enhancer\xe2\x80\x91like lncRNAs and overlapping, antisense or nearby mRNA pairs. Coexpression networks were subsequently constructed and investigated. The expression levels of the lncRNAs, NR_036693, NR_027783, NR_033766 and NR_001284, were significantly altered. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated the potential role of lncRNAs in the regulation of central process, including inflammatory response, response to endogenous stimulus and antigen processing and presentation. The use of bioinformatics may help to uncover and analyze large quantities of data identified by microarray analyses, through rigorous experimental planning, statistical analysis and the collection of more comprehensive data regarding CTEPH. The results of the present study provided evidence which may be helpful in future studies on the diagnosis and management of CTEPH.'

aS'Alternative non-coding splice variants of Nespas, an imprinted gene antisense to Nesp in the Gnas imprinting cluster.\r\nThe Gnas locus on mouse Chr 2 represents a unique cluster of overlapping imprinted genes. Three of these in the order Nesp--Gnasxl--Gnas are transcribed in the sense direction with Nesp having maternal-specific expression, Gnasxl having paternal expression, and Gnas as being biallelically expressed in most tissues. A fourth imprinted gene, Nespas, is paternally expressed, lies antisense to Nesp, and expresses an unspliced transcript. Large unspliced antisense transcripts are emerging as a feature of imprinted gene clusters, and such non-coding RNAs may have a cis-regulatory function. Here we show that, in addition to an unspliced form of Nepas, we can detect five alternatively spliced forms of Nespas up to 1.4 kb in length that are non-coding. The splice variants are paternally expressed; they start approximately 2 kb upstream of Gnasxl in a region of maternal methylation and end 2.5 kb beyond the ATG of Nesp. These variants do not correspond to exons of the human antisense transcript although they start in the same region; the Nespas transcript, like its human counterpart, is spliced in various alternative patterns. The identification of a set of small spliced imprinted transcripts in the human and now in the mouse suggests that these antisense transcripts are functionally important.'

aS'Single nucleotide polymorphisms with cis-regulatory effects on long non-coding transcripts in human primary monocytes.\r\nWe applied genome-wide allele-specific expression analysis of monocytes from 188 samples. Monocytes were purified from white blood cells of healthy blood donors to detect cis-acting genetic variation that regulates the expression of long non-coding RNAs. We analysed 8929 regions harboring genes for potential long non-coding RNA that were retrieved from data from the ENCODE project. Of these regions, 60% were annotated as intergenic, which implies that they do not overlap with protein-coding genes. Focusing on the intergenic regions, and using stringent analysis of the allele-specific expression data, we detected robust cis-regulatory SNPs in 258 out of 489 informative intergenic regions included in the analysis. The cis-regulatory SNPs that were significantly associated with allele-specific expression of long non-coding RNAs were enriched to enhancer regions marked for active or bivalent, poised chromatin by histone modifications. Out of the lncRNA regions regulated by cis-acting regulatory SNPs, 20% (n\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a52) were co-regulated with the closest protein coding gene. We compared the identified cis-regulatory SNPs with those in the catalog of SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies of human diseases and traits. This comparison identified 32 SNPs in loci from genome-wide association studies that displayed a strong association signal with allele-specific expression of non-coding RNAs in monocytes, with p-values ranging from 6.7\xc3\x9710(-7) to 9.5\xc3\x9710(-89). The identified cis-regulatory SNPs are associated with diseases of the immune system, like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.'

aS'Chromatin remodeling complexes in the assembly of long noncoding RNA-dependent nuclear bodies.\r\nParaspeckles are subnuclear structures that assemble on nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) long noncoding (lnc)RNA. Paraspeckle formation requires appropriate NEAT1 biogenesis and subsequent assembly with multiple prion-like domain (PLD) containing RNA-binding proteins. We found that SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes function as paraspeckle components that interact with paraspeckle proteins (PSPs) and NEAT1. SWI/SNF complexes play an essential role in paraspeckle formation that does not require their ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity. Instead, SWI/SNF complexes facilitate organization of the PSP interaction network required for intact paraspeckle assembly. SWI/SNF complexes may collectively bind multiple PSPs to recruit them onto NEAT1. SWI/SNF complexes are also required for Sat III (Satellite III) lncRNA-dependent formation of nuclear stress bodies under heat shock conditions. Organization of the lncRNA-dependent omega speckle in Drosophila also depends on the chromatin remodeling complex. These findings raise the possibility that a common mechanism controls the formation of lncRNA-dependent nuclear body architecture.'

aS"Predicting lncRNA-disease associations and constructing lncRNA functional similarity network based on the information of miRNA.\r\nAccumulating experimental studies have indicated that lncRNAs play important roles in various critical biological process and their alterations and dysregulations have been associated with many important complex diseases. Developing effective computational models to predict potential disease-lncRNA association could benefit not only the understanding of disease mechanism at lncRNA level, but also the detection of disease biomarkers for disease diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention. However, known experimentally confirmed disease-lncRNA associations are still very limited. In this study, a novel model of HyperGeometric distribution for LncRNA-Disease Association inference (HGLDA) was developed to predict lncRNA-disease associations by integrating miRNA-disease associations and lncRNA-miRNA interactions. Although HGLDA didn't rely on any known disease-lncRNA associations, it still obtained an AUC of 0.7621 in the leave-one-out cross validation. Furthermore, 19 predicted associations for breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer were verified by biological experimental studies. Furthermore, the model of LncRNA Functional Similarity Calculation based on the information of MiRNA (LFSCM) was developed to calculate lncRNA functional similarity on a large scale by integrating disease semantic similarity, miRNA-disease associations, and miRNA-lncRNA interactions. It is anticipated that HGLDA and LFSCM could be effective biological tools for biomedical research."

aS'Functional importance of cardiac enhancer-associated noncoding RNAs in heart development and disease.\r\nThe key information processing units within gene regulatory networks are enhancers. Enhancer activity is associated with the production of tissue-specific noncoding RNAs, yet the existence of such transcripts during cardiac development has not been established. Using an integrated genomic approach, we demonstrate that fetal cardiac enhancers generate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) during cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis. Enhancer expression correlates with the emergence of active enhancer chromatin states, the initiation of RNA polymerase II at enhancer loci and expression of target genes. Orthologous human sequences are also transcribed in fetal human hearts and cardiac progenitor cells. Through a systematic bioinformatic analysis, we identified and characterized, for the first time, a catalog of lncRNAs that are expressed during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cardiomyocytes and associated with active cardiac enhancer sequences. RNA-sequencing demonstrates that many of these transcripts are polyadenylated, multi-exonic long noncoding RNAs. Moreover, knockdown of two enhancer-associated lncRNAs resulted in the specific downregulation of their predicted target genes. Interestingly, the reactivation of the fetal gene program, a hallmark of the stress response in the adult heart, is accompanied by increased expression of fetal cardiac enhancer transcripts. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the activity of cardiac enhancers and expression of their target genes are associated with the production of enhancer-derived lncRNAs.'

aS'Transcriptome analysis of psoriasis in a large case-control sample: RNA-seq provides insights into disease mechanisms.\r\nTo increase our understanding of psoriasis, we used high-throughput complementary DNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to assay the transcriptomes of lesional psoriatic and normal skin. We sequenced polyadenylated RNA-derived complementary DNAs from 92 psoriatic and 82 normal punch biopsies, generating an average of \xe2\x88\xbc38 million single-end 80-bp reads per sample. Comparison of 42 samples examined by both RNA-seq and microarray revealed marked differences in sensitivity, with transcripts identified only by RNA-seq having much lower expression than those also identified by microarray. RNA-seq identified many more differentially expressed transcripts enriched in immune system processes. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed multiple modules of coordinately expressed epidermal differentiation genes, overlapping significantly with genes regulated by the long noncoding RNA TINCR, its target gene, staufen-1 (STAU1), the p63 target gene ZNF750, and its target KLF4. Other coordinately expressed modules were enriched for lymphoid and/or myeloid signature transcripts and genes induced by IL-17 in keratinocytes. Dermally expressed genes were significantly downregulated in psoriatic biopsies, most likely because of expansion of the epidermal compartment. These results show the power of WGCNA to elucidate gene regulatory circuits in psoriasis, and emphasize the influence of tissue architecture in both differential expression and coexpression analysis.'

aS'Dysregulation of FOXG1 by ring chromosome 14.\r\nIn this study we performed molecular characterization of a patient with an extra ring chromosome derived from chromosome 14, with severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, cerebral paresis, tetraplegia, osteoporosis and severe thoraco-lumbal scoliosis. Array CGH analysis did not show any genomic imbalance but conventional karyotyping and FISH analysis revealed the presence of an interstitial 14q12q24.3 deletion and an extra ring chromosome derived from the deleted material. The deletion and ring chromosome breakpoints were identified at base-pair level by mate-pair and Sanger sequencing. Both breakpoints disrupted putative long non-coding RNA genes (TCONS00022561;RP11-148E17.1) of unknown function. However, the proximal breakpoint was 225\xc2\xa0kb downstream of the forkhead box G1 gene (FOXG1), within the known regulatory landscape of FOXG1. The patient represents the first case of a r(14) arising from an interstitial excision where the phenotype is compatible with dysregulation of FOXG1. In turn, the phenotypic overlap between the present case, the FOXG1 syndrome and the r(14) syndrome supports that dysregulation of FOXG1 may contribute to the classical r(14)-syndrome, likely mediated by dynamic mosaicism.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA profiles of adrenocortical cancer can be used to predict recurrence.\r\nAdrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignancy with high rates of recurrence following surgical resection. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cancer development. Pathogenesis of adrenal tumours have been characterised by mRNA, microRNA and methylation expression signatures, but it is unknown if this extends to lncRNAs. This study describes lncRNA expression signatures in ACC, adrenal cortical adenoma (ACA) and normal adrenal cortex (NAC) and presents lncRNAs associated with ACC recurrence to identify novel prognostic and therapeutic targets. RNA was extracted from freshly frozen tissue with confirmation of diagnosis by histopathology. Focused lncRNA and mRNA transcriptome analysis was performed using the ArrayStar Human LncRNA V3.0 microarray. Differentially expressed lncRNAs were validated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and correlated with clinical outcomes. Microarray of 21 samples (ten ACCs, five ACAs and six NACs) showed distinct patterns of lncRNA expression between each group. A total of 956 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and NAC, including known carcinogenesis-related lncRNAs such as H19, GAS5, MALAT1 and PRINS (P\xe2\x89\xa40.05); 85 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between ACC and ACA (P\xe2\x89\xa40.05). Hierarchical clustering and heat mapping showed ACC samples correctly grouped compared with NAC and ACA. Sixty-six differentially expressed lncRNAs were found to be associated with ACC recurrence (P\xe2\x89\xa40.05), one of which, PRINS, was validated in a group of 20 ACCs and also found to be associated with metastatic disease on presentation. The pathogenesis of adrenal tumours extends to lncRNA dysregulation and low expression of the lncRNA PRINS is associated with ACC recurrence.'

aS'Unbiased analysis of potential targets of breast cancer susceptibility loci by Capture Hi-C.\r\nGenome-wide association studies have identified more than 70 common variants that are associated with breast cancer risk. Most of these variants map to non-protein-coding regions and several map to gene deserts, regions of several hundred kilobases lacking protein-coding genes. We hypothesized that gene deserts harbor long-range regulatory elements that can physically interact with target genes to influence their expression. To test this, we developed Capture Hi-C (CHi-C), which, by incorporating a sequence capture step into a Hi-C protocol, allows high-resolution analysis of targeted regions of the genome. We used CHi-C to investigate long-range interactions at three breast cancer gene deserts mapping to 2q35, 8q24.21, and 9q31.2. We identified interaction peaks between putative regulatory elements ("bait fragments") within the captured regions and "targets" that included both protein-coding genes and long noncoding (lnc) RNAs over distances of 6.6 kb to 2.6 Mb. Target protein-coding genes were IGFBP5, KLF4, NSMCE2, and MYC; and target lncRNAs included DIRC3, PVT1, and CCDC26. For one gene desert, we were able to define two SNPs (rs12613955 and rs4442975) that were highly correlated with the published risk variant and that mapped within the bait end of an interaction peak. In vivo ChIP-qPCR data show that one of these, rs4442975, affects the binding of FOXA1 and implicate this SNP as a putative functional variant.'

aS'Loss of estrogen-regulated microRNA expression increases HER2 signaling and is prognostic of poor outcome in luminal breast cancer.\r\nAmong the genes regulated by estrogen receptor (ER) are miRNAs that play a role in breast cancer signaling pathways. To determine whether miRNAs are involved in ER-positive breast cancer progression to hormone independence, we profiled the expression of 800 miRNAs in the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF7 and its estrogen-independent derivative MCF7:2A (MCF7:2A) using NanoString. We found 78 miRNAs differentially expressed between the two cell lines, including a cluster comprising let-7c, miR99a, and miR125b, which is encoded in an intron of the long noncoding RNA LINC00478. These miRNAs are ER targets in MCF7 cells, and nearby ER binding and their expression are significantly decreased in MCF7:2A cells. The expression of these miRNAs was interrogated in patient samples profiled in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Among luminal tumors, these miRNAs are expressed at higher levels in luminal A versus B tumors. Although their expression is uniformly low in luminal B tumors, they are lost only in a subset of luminal A patients. Interestingly, this subset with low expression of these miRNAs had worse overall survival compared with luminal A patients with high expression. We confirmed that miR125b directly targets HER2 and that let-7c also regulates HER2 protein expression. In addition, HER2 protein expression and activity are negatively correlated with let-7c expression in TCGA. In summary, we identified an ER-regulated miRNA cluster that regulates HER2, is lost with progression to estrogen independence, and may serve as a biomarker of poor outcome in ER(+) luminal A breast cancer patients.'

aS'MYC regulates the non-coding transcriptome.\r\nUsing RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) of ribosome-depleted RNA, we have identified 1,273 lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) in P493-6 human B-cells. Of these, 534 are either up- or downregulated in response to MYC overexpression. An increase in MYC occupancy near their TSS (transcription start sites) was observed for MYC-responsive lncRNAs suggesting these are direct MYC targets. MYC binds to the same TSS across several cell lines, but the number of TSS bound depends on cellular MYC levels and increases with higher MYC concentrations. Despite this concordance in promoter binding, a majority of expressed lncRNAs are specific for one cell line, suggesting a determinant role of additional, possibly differentiation-specific factors in the activity of MYC-bound lncRNA promoters. A significant fraction of the lncRNA transcripts lack polyadenylation. The RNA-seq data were confirmed on eight selected lncRNAs by NRO (nuclear run-on) and RT-qPCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR).'

aS'A de novo balanced t(2;6)(p15;p22.3) in a patient with West Syndrome disrupts a lnc-RNA.\r\nIn a male patient with West Syndrome we identified a perfectly balanced, de novo balanced translocation 46,XY,t(2;6)(p15;p22.3). No known protein coding genes were disrupted by the translocation and positional effects on nearby genes were excluded by expression studies. A putative long non-coding RNA, BX118339, spans the breakpoint on chromosome 6. It can be hypothesized that disruption of this non-coding transcript plays a role in the pathogenesis of the patient.'

aS"7SL RNA is retained in HIV-1 minimal virus-like particles as an S-domain fragment.\r\nHIV-1 is known to package several small cellular RNAs in addition to its genome. Previous work consistently demonstrated that the host structural RNA 7SL is abundant in HIV-1 virions but has yielded conflicting results regarding whether 7SL is present in minimal, assembly-competent virus-like particles (VLPs). Here, we demonstrate that minimal HIV-1 VLPs retain 7SL RNA primarily as an endoribonucleolytic fragment, referred to as 7SL remnant (7SLrem). Nuclease mapping showed that 7SLrem is a 111-nucleotide internal portion of 7SL, with 5' and 3' ends corresponding to unpaired loops in the 7SL two-dimensional structure. Analysis of VLPs comprised of different subsets of Gag domains revealed that all NC-positive VLPs contained intact 7SL while the presence of 7SLrem correlated with the absence of the NC domain. Because 7SLrem, which maps to the 7SL S domain, was not detectable in infected cells, we propose a model whereby the species recruited to assembling VLPs is intact 7SL RNA, with 7SLrem produced by an endoribonuclease in the absence of NC. Since recruitment of 7SL RNA was a conserved feature of all tested minimal VLPs, our model further suggests that 7SL's recruitment is mediated, either directly or indirectly, through interactions with conserved features of all tested VLPs, such as the C-terminal domain of CA."

aS'Transposable elements are major contributors to the origin, diversification, and regulation of vertebrate long noncoding RNAs.\r\nAdvances in vertebrate genomics have uncovered thousands of loci encoding long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While progress has been made in elucidating the regulatory functions of lncRNAs, little is known about their origins and evolution. Here we explore the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to the makeup and regulation of lncRNAs in human, mouse, and zebrafish. Surprisingly, TEs occur in more than two thirds of mature lncRNA transcripts and account for a substantial portion of total lncRNA sequence (~30% in human), whereas they seldom occur in protein-coding transcripts. While TEs contribute less to lncRNA exons than expected, several TE families are strongly enriched in lncRNAs. There is also substantial interspecific variation in the coverage and types of TEs embedded in lncRNAs, partially reflecting differences in the TE landscapes of the genomes surveyed. In human, TE sequences in lncRNAs evolve under greater evolutionary constraint than their non-TE sequences, than their intronic TEs, or than random DNA. Consistent with functional constraint, we found that TEs contribute signals essential for the biogenesis of many lncRNAs, including ~30,000 unique sites for transcription initiation, splicing, or polyadenylation in human. In addition, we identified ~35,000 TEs marked as open chromatin located within 10 kb upstream of lncRNA genes. The density of these marks in one cell type correlate with elevated expression of the downstream lncRNA in the same cell type, suggesting that these TEs contribute to cis-regulation. These global trends are recapitulated in several lncRNAs with established functions. Finally a subset of TEs embedded in lncRNAs are subject to RNA editing and predicted to form secondary structures likely important for function. In conclusion, TEs are nearly ubiquitous in lncRNAs and have played an important role in the lineage-specific diversification of vertebrate lncRNA repertoires.'

aS"Long non-coding RNA and alternative splicing modulations in Parkinson's leukocytes identified by RNA sequencing.\r\nThe continuously prolonged human lifespan is accompanied by increase in neurodegenerative diseases incidence, calling for the development of inexpensive blood-based diagnostics. Analyzing blood cell transcripts by RNA-Seq is a robust means to identify novel biomarkers that rapidly becomes a commonplace. However, there is lack of tools to discover novel exons, junctions and splicing events and to precisely and sensitively assess differential splicing through RNA-Seq data analysis and across RNA-Seq platforms. Here, we present a new and comprehensive computational workflow for whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq analysis, using an updated version of the software AltAnalyze, to identify both known and novel high-confidence alternative splicing events, and to integrate them with both protein-domains and microRNA binding annotations. We applied the novel workflow on RNA-Seq data from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients' leukocytes pre- and post- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) treatment and compared to healthy controls. Disease-mediated changes included decreased usage of alternative promoters and N-termini, 5'-end variations and mutually-exclusive exons. The PD regulated FUS and HNRNP A/B included prion-like domains regulated regions. We also present here a workflow to identify and analyze long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via RNA-Seq data. We identified reduced lncRNA expression and selective PD-induced changes in 13 of over 6,000 detected leukocyte lncRNAs, four of which were inversely altered post-DBS. These included the U1 spliceosomal lncRNA and RP11-462G22.1, each entailing sequence complementarity to numerous microRNAs. Analysis of RNA-Seq from PD and unaffected controls brains revealed over 7,000 brain-expressed lncRNAs, of which 3,495 were co-expressed in the leukocytes including U1, which showed both leukocyte and brain increases. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validations confirmed these co-increases in PD leukocytes and two brain regions, the amygdala and substantia-nigra, compared to controls. This novel workflow allows deep multi-level inspection of RNA-Seq datasets and provides a comprehensive new resource for understanding disease transcriptome modifications in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

aS'Decreased expression of MEG3 contributes to retinoblastoma progression and affects retinoblastoma cell growth by regulating the activity of Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway.\r\nThe aberrant expression of MEG3 has been found in some types of cancers; however, little is known concerning the function of MEG3 in retinoblastoma. To elucidate the roles of MEG3 in retinoblastoma, MEG3 expression was quantified in 63 retinoblastoma samples and corresponding nontumor tissues in this work. Moreover, retinoblastoma cell lines were transfected with pcDNA3.1-MEG3 or si-MEG3, after which proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of \xce\xb2-catenin were assayed. TOP-Flash reporter assay was also used to investigate the activity of the Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway. The results showed that MEG3 was downregulated in retinoblastoma tissues, and the level of MEG3 was negatively associated with IIRC stages and nodal or distant metastasis. More importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that patients with low MEG3 expression had poorer survival and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that MEG3 was an independent prognostic factor in retinoblastoma patients. We also observed that MEG3 expression can be modulated by DNA methylation by using 5-aza-CdR treatment. In addition, overexpression of MEG3 suppressed proliferation, promoted apoptosis, and influences the activity of the Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway in retinoblastoma cell lines. Furthermore, we found that Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway activator rescued the anticancer effect of MEG3 in retinoblastoma. In conclusion, our study for the first time demonstrated that MEG3 was a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating the activity of the Wnt/\xce\xb2-catenin pathway in the progression of retinoblastoma and might serve as a prognostic biomarker and molecular therapeutic target.'

aS'Identification of short-lived long non-coding RNAs as surrogate indicators for chemical stress response.\r\nAbiotic and biotic stressors in human cells are often a result of sudden and/or frequent changes in environmental factors. The molecular response to stress involves elaborate modulation of gene expression and is of homeostatic, ecological, and evolutionary importance. Although attention has primarily focused on signaling pathways and protein networks, long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are increasingly involved in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to cellular stresses. We identified six novel short-lived long ncRNAs (MIR22HG, GABPB-AS1, LINC00152, IDI2-AS1, SNHG15, and FLJ33630) that responded to chemical stressors (cisplatin, cycloheximide, and mercury (II) oxide) in HeLa Tet-off cells. Our results indicate that short-lived long ncRNAs respond to general and specific chemical stressors. The expression levels of the short-lived long ncRNAs were elevated because of prolonged decay rates in response to chemical stressors and interruption of RNA degradation pathways. We propose that these long ncRNAs have the potential to be surrogate indicators of cellular stress responses.'

aS'The spinocerebellar ataxia 8 noncoding RNA causes neurodegeneration and associates with staufen in Drosophila.\r\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia 8 (SCA8) appears unique among triplet repeat expansion-induced neurodegenerative diseases because the predicted gene product is a noncoding RNA. Little is currently known about the normal function of SCA8 in neuronal survival or how repeat expansion contributes to neurodegeneration. To investigate the molecular context in which SCA8 operates, we have expressed the human SCA8 noncoding RNA in Drosophila. SCA8 induces late-onset, progressive neurodegeneration in the Drosophila retina. Using this neurodegenerative phenotype as a sensitized background for a genetic modifier screen, we have identified mutations in four genes: staufen, muscle-blind, split ends, and CG3249. All four encode neuronally expressed RNA binding proteins conserved in Drosophila and humans. Although expression of both wild-type and repeat-expanded SCA8 induce neurodegeneration, the strength of interaction with certain modifiers differs between the two SCA8 backgrounds, suggesting that CUG expansions alter associations with specific RNA binding proteins. Our demonstration that SCA8 can recruit Staufen and that the interaction domain maps to the portion of the SCA8 RNA that undergoes repeat expansion in the human disease suggests a specific mechanism for SCA8 function and disease. Genetic modifiers identified in our SCA8-based screens may provide candidates for designing therapeutic interventions to treat this disease.'

aS"Genome-scale long noncoding RNA expression pattern in squamous cell lung cancer.\r\nIn this study, we aimed to explore the long noncoding RNA expression pattern in squamous cell lung cancer (SQCC) on a genome-wide scale. Total RNAs were extracted from 16 lung SQCC patients' normal and matched lung cancer tissues by Trizol reagent. The expression level of genome-wide scale lncRNA and mRNA was determined by microarray. qRT-PCR was used to validate the lncRNA expression level in 47 patients. Data analyses were performed using R and Bioconductor. A total of 2,748 up and 852 down regulated probes were identified to be significantly and differentially expressed in tumor tissues. The annotation result of their co-expressed mRNAs showed that the most significantly related category of GO analysis was development and differentiation, while the most significantly related pathway was cell cycle. Subgroup analysis identified that 46 and 18 probes were specifically differentially expressed in smoking and moderately differentiated tumors, respectively. Our study indicated that clusters of lncRNAs were significantly and differentially expressed in SQCC compared with normal tissues in the same subject. They may exert a significant role in lung cancer development and could be potential targets for future treatment of SQCC."

aS'A genome-wide association study for diabetic retinopathy in a Japanese population: potential association with a long intergenic non-coding RNA.\r\nElucidation of the genetic susceptibility factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of DR, and may help to define genetic risk factors for this condition. In the present study, we conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify DR susceptibility loci in Japanese patients, which comprised a total of 837 type 2 diabetes patients with DR (cases) and 1,149 without DR (controls). From the stage 1 genome-wide scan of 446 subjects (205 cases and 241 controls) on 614,216 SNPs, 249 SNPs were selected for the stage 2 replication in 623 subjects (335 cases and 288 controls). Eight SNPs were further followed up in a stage 3 study of 297 cases and 620 controls. The top signal from the present association analysis was rs9362054 in an intron of RP1-90L14.1 showing borderline genome-wide significance (Pmet\xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a1.4\xc3\x9710(-7), meta-analysis of stage 1 and stage 2, allele model). RP1-90L14.1 is a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) adjacent to KIAA1009/QN1/CEP162 gene; CEP162 plays a critical role in ciliary transition zone formation before ciliogenesis. The present study raises the possibility that the dysregulation of ciliary-associated genes plays a role in susceptibility to DR.'

aS'Do circulating long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (LincRNA-p21, GAS 5, HOTAIR) predict the treatment response in patients with head and neck cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy?\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be aberrantly expressed in head and neck cancer (HNC). The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma levels of three lncRNA molecules (lincRNA-p21, GAS5, and HOTAIR) in the treatment response in HNC patients treated with radical chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Forty-one patients with HNC were enrolled in the study. Most of the patients had nasopharyngeal carcinoma (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8927, 65.9\xc2\xa0%) and locally advanced disease. Blood was drawn at baseline and treatment evaluation 4.5\xc2\xa0months after therapy. lncRNAs in plasma were measured by semiquantitative PCR. Treatment response was evaluated according to clinical examination, RECIST and PERCIST criteria based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) findings. Complete response (CR) rates were 73.2, 36.6, and 50\xc2\xa0% for clinical investigation, PET/CT-, or MRI-based response evaluation, respectively. Predictive value of lncRNAs was investigated in patients with CR vs. those with partial response (PR)/progressive disease (PD). We found that post-treatment GAS5 levels in patients with PR/PD were significantly higher compared with patients with CR based on clinical investigation (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.01). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that at a cutoff value of 0.3 of GAS5, sensitivity and specificity for clinical tumor response were 82 and 77\xc2\xa0%, respectively. Interestingly, pretreatment GAS5 levels were significantly increased in patients with PR/PD compared to those with CR upon MRI-based response evaluation (p\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.042). In contrast to GAS5, pretreatment or post-treatment lincRNA-p21 and HOTAIR levels were not informative for treatment response. Our results suggest that circulating GAS5 could be a biomarker in predicting treatment response in HNC patients.'

aS'Human long non-coding RNAs promote pluripotency and neuronal differentiation by association with chromatin modifiers and transcription factors.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a numerous class of newly discovered genes in the human genome, which have been proposed to be key regulators of biological processes, including stem cell pluripotency and neurogenesis. However, at present very little functional characterization of lncRNAs in human differentiation has been carried out. In the present study, we address this using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a paradigm for pluripotency and neuronal differentiation. With a newly developed method, hESCs were robustly and efficiently differentiated into neurons, and we profiled the expression of thousands of lncRNAs using a custom-designed microarray. Some hESC-specific lncRNAs involved in pluripotency maintenance were identified, and shown to physically interact with SOX2, and PRC2 complex component, SUZ12. Using a similar approach, we identified lncRNAs required for neurogenesis. Knockdown studies indicated that loss of any of these lncRNAs blocked neurogenesis, and immunoprecipitation studies revealed physical association with REST and SUZ12. This study indicates that lncRNAs are important regulators of pluripotency and neurogenesis, and represents important evidence for an indispensable role of lncRNAs in human brain development.'

These ncRNAs can interact with DNA, RNA and protein molecules; engage in diverse structural, functional and regulatory activities; and have roles in nuclear organization and transcriptional, post-transcriptional and epigenetic processes. This expanding inventory of ncRNAs is implicated in mediating a broad spectrum of processes including brain evolution, development, synaptic plasticity and disease pathogenesis.'

aS'Differential lncRNA expression profiles in recurrent gliomas compared with primary gliomas identified by microarray analysis.\r\nGlioma, especially high-grade glioma, is highly malignant with high rate of recurrence and poor prognosis. The mechanisms of glioma progression and recurrence have not been elucidated. Previous studies showed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in the development and progression of glioma. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the recurrence of glioma remain unknown. We use high throughput microarray to screen the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in recurrence gliomas compared with primary gliomas. We found a total of 1,111 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in recurrent group. Among these, 639 lncRNAs were up-regulated, while 472 lncRNAs were down-regulated (fold Change \xe2\x89\xa52.0). GO (Gene ontology) and pathway analysis revealed that the potential functions of differentially expressed lncRNAs were closely connected with the processes of cancer progression and pathogenesis. LncRNA classification and subgroup analysis further identified three important clusters of differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs which have potential gene regulatory functions. This study for the first time showed abundant differentially expressed lncRNAs in recurrent gliomas. Some lncRNAs may play important roles in glioma recurrence, such as previously reported H19, CRNDE, HOTAIRM1 or unreported AC016745.3, XLOC_001711, RP11-128A17.1. Moreover, this study set a basis for future researches on specific lncRNA which may contribute to the recurrence of glioma. Further studies on these lncRNAs will help to elucidate the mechanism of glioma recurrence at genetic level and find therapeutic targets for glioma patients.'

aS'SNP@lincTFBS: an integrated database of polymorphisms in human LincRNA transcription factor binding sites.\r\nLarge intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a new class of functional transcripts, and aberrant expression of lincRNAs was associated with several human diseases. The genetic variants in lincRNA transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) can change lincRNA expression, thereby affecting the susceptibility to human diseases. To identify and annotate these functional candidates, we have developed a database SNP@lincTFBS, which is devoted to the exploration and annotation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in potential TFBSs of human lincRNAs. We identified 6,665 SNPs in 6,614 conserved TFBSs of 2,423 human lincRNAs. In addition, with ChIPSeq dataset, we identified 139,576 SNPs in 304,517 transcription factor peaks of 4,813 lincRNAs. We also performed comprehensive annotation for these SNPs using 1000 Genomes Project datasets across 11 populations. Moreover, one of the distinctive features of SNP@lincTFBS is the collection of disease-associated SNPs in the lincRNA TFBSs and SNPs in the TFBSs of disease-associated lincRNAs. The web interface enables both flexible data searches and downloads. Quick search can be query of lincRNA name, SNP identifier, or transcription factor name. SNP@lincTFBS provides significant advances in identification of disease-associated lincRNA variants and improved convenience to interpret the discrepant expression of lincRNAs. The SNP@lincTFBS database is available at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/SNP_lincTFBS.'

aS"Roles of microRNAs and long-noncoding RNAs in human immunodeficiency virus replication.\r\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes, including viral replication. In this review, the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication will be discussed. The review focuses on miRNAs that target cellular proteins involved in HIV replication-proteins that mediate steps in the viral life cycle, as well as proteins of the innate immune system that inhibit HIV replication. Given the large number of miRNAs encoded in the human genome, as well as the large number of cellular proteins involved in HIV replication, the number of miRNAs identified to date that affect viral replication are certainly only the 'tip of the iceberg'. The review also discusses two lncRNAs that are involved in HIV gene regulation-7SK RNA and NEAT1 RNA. 7SK RNA is involved in HIV Tat protein stimulation of RNA polymerase II elongation of the integrated provirus, while NEAT1 RNA is involved in HIV Rev protein export of incompletely spliced viral transcripts."

aS'MYC-repressed long noncoding RNAs antagonize MYC-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.\r\nThe transcription factor MYC is a proto-oncogene regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and metabolism. The recent identification of MYC-regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) expands our knowledge of the role of lncRNAs in MYC functions. Here, we identify MYC-repressed lncRNAs named MYCLo-4, -5 and -6 by comparing 3 categories of lncRNAs (downregulated in highly MYC-expressing colorectal cancer, up-regulated by MYC knockdown in HCT116, upregulated by MYC knockdown in RKO). The MYC-repressed MYCLos are implicated in MYC-modulated cell proliferation through cell cycle regulation. By screening cell cycle-related genes regulated by MYC and the MYC-repressed MYCLos, we identified the MYC-repressed gene GADD45A as a target gene of the MYC-repressed MYCLos such as MYCLo-4 and MYCLo-6.'

aS'The noncoding RNA IPW regulates the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 locus in an induced pluripotent stem cell model of Prader-Willi syndrome.\r\nParental imprinting is a form of epigenetic regulation that results in parent-of-origin differential gene expression. To study Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a developmental imprinting disorder, we generated case-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) harboring distinct aberrations in the affected region on chromosome 15. In studying PWS-iPSCs and human parthenogenetic iPSCs, we unexpectedly found substantial upregulation of virtually all maternally expressed genes (MEGs) in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 locus on chromosome 14. Subsequently, we determined that IPW, a long noncoding RNA in the critical region of the PWS locus, is a regulator of the DLK1-DIO3 region, as its overexpression in PWS and parthenogenetic iPSCs resulted in downregulation of MEGs in this locus. We further show that gene expression changes in the DLK1-DIO3 region coincide with chromatin modifications rather than DNA methylation levels. Our results suggest that a subset of PWS phenotypes may arise from dysregulation of an imprinted locus distinct from the PWS region.'

aS'Dissecting the nascent human transcriptome by analysing the RNA content of transcription factories.\r\nWhile mapping total and poly-adenylated human transcriptomes has now become routine, characterizing nascent transcripts remains challenging, largely because nascent RNAs have such short half-lives. Here, we describe a simple, fast and cost-effective method to isolate RNA associated with transcription factories, the sites responsible for the majority of nuclear transcription. Following stimulation of human endothelial cells with the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF\xce\xb1, we isolate and analyse the RNA content of factories by sequencing. Comparison with total, poly(A)(+) and chromatin RNA fractions reveals that sequencing of purified factory RNA maps the complete nascent transcriptome; it is rich in intronic unprocessed transcript, as well as long intergenic non-coding (lincRNAs) and enhancer-associated RNAs (eRNAs), micro-RNA precursors and repeat-derived RNAs. Hence, we verify that transcription factories produce most nascent RNA and confer a regulatory role via their association with a set of specifically-retained non-coding transcripts.'

aS'p50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA (PACER) activates COX-2 gene expression by occluding repressive NF-\xce\xbaB complexes.\r\nDeregulated expression of COX-2 has been causally linked to development, progression, and outcome of several types of human cancer. We describe a novel fundamental level of transcriptional control of COX-2 expression. Using primary human mammary epithelial cells and monocyte/macrophage cell lines, we show that the chromatin boundary/insulator factor CTCF establishes an open chromatin domain and induces expression of a long non-coding RNA within the upstream promoter region of COX-2. Upon induction of COX-2 expression, the lncRNA associates with p50, a repressive subunit of NF-\xce\xbaB, and occludes it from the COX-2 promoter, potentially facilitating interaction with activation-competent NF-\xce\xbaB p65/p50 dimers. This enables recruitment of the p300 histone acetyltransferase, a domain-wide increase in histone acetylation and assembly of RNA Polymerase II initiation complexes. Our findings reveal an unexpected mechanism of gene control by lncRNA-mediated repressor occlusion and identify the COX-2-lncRNA, PACER, as a new potential target for COX-2-modulation in inflammation and cancer.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01776.001.'

aS'Systematic identification and characterization of long intergenic non-coding RNAs in fetal porcine skeletal muscle development.\r\nLong intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) play important roles in many cellular processes. Here, we present the first systematic identification and characterization of lincRNAs in fetal porcine skeletal muscle. We obtained a total of 55.02 million 90-bp paired-end reads and assembled 54,550 transcripts using cufflinks. We developed a pipeline to identify 570 multi-exon lincRNAs by integrating a set of previous approaches. These putative porcine lincRNAs share many characteristics with mammalian lincRNAs, such as a relatively short length, small number of exons and low level of sequence conservation. We found that the porcine lincRNAs were preferentially located near genes mediating transcriptional regulation rather than those with developmental functions. We further experimentally analyzed the features of a conserved mouse lincRNA gene and found that isoforms 1 and 4 of this lincRNA were enriched in the cell nucleus and were associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Our results provide a catalog of fetal porcine lincRNAs for further experimental investigation of the functions of these genes in the skeletal muscle developmental process.'

aS'CALML5 is a ZNF750- and TINCR-induced protein that binds stratifin to regulate epidermal differentiation.\r\nOutward migration of epidermal progenitors occurs with induction of hundreds of differentiation genes, but the identities of all regulators required for this process are unknown. We used laser capture microdissection followed by RNA sequencing to identify calmodulin-like 5 (CALML5) as the most enriched gene in differentiating outer epidermis. CALML5 mRNA was up-regulated by the ZNF750 transcription factor and then stabilized by the long noncoding RNA TINCR. CALML5 knockout impaired differentiation, abolished keratohyalin granules, and disrupted epidermal barrier function. Mass spectrometry identified SFN (stratifin/14-3-3\xcf\x83) as a CALML5-binding protein. CALML5 interacts with SFN in suprabasal epidermis, cocontrols 13% of late differentiation genes, and modulates interaction of SFN to some of its binding partners. A ZNF750-TINCR-CALML5-SFN network is thus essential for epidermal differentiation.'

aS'Genome-wide analysis of the human p53 transcriptional network unveils a lncRNA tumour suppressor signature.\r\nDespite the inarguable relevance of p53 in cancer, genome-wide studies relating endogenous p53 activity to the expression of lncRNAs in human cells are still missing. Here, by integrating RNA-seq with p53 ChIP-seq analyses of a human cancer cell line under DNA damage, we define a high-confidence set of 18 lncRNAs that are p53 transcriptional targets. We demonstrate that two of the p53-regulated lncRNAs are required for the efficient binding of p53 to some of its target genes, modulating the p53 transcriptional network and contributing to apoptosis induction by DNA damage. We also show that the expression of p53-lncRNAs is lowered in colorectal cancer samples, constituting a tumour suppressor signature with high diagnostic power. Thus, p53-regulated lncRNAs establish a positive regulatory feedback loop that enhances p53 tumour suppressor activity. Furthermore, the signature defined by p53-regulated lncRNAs supports their potential use in the clinic as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.'

aS'Comprehensive analysis of long non-coding RNAs in ovarian cancer reveals global patterns and targeted DNA amplification.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as potent regulators of cell physiology, and recent studies highlight their role in tumor development. However, while established protein-coding oncogenes and tumor suppressors often display striking patterns of focal DNA copy-number alteration in tumors, similar evidence is largely lacking for lncRNAs. Here, we report on a genomic analysis of GENCODE lncRNAs in high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular profiles. Using genomic copy-number data and deep coverage transcriptome sequencing, we derived dual copy-number and expression data for 10,419 lncRNAs across 407 primary tumors. We describe global correlations between lncRNA copy-number and expression, and associate established expression subtypes with distinct lncRNA signatures. By examining regions of focal copy-number change that lack protein-coding targets, we identified an intergenic lncRNA on chromosome 1, OVAL, that shows narrow focal genomic amplification in a subset of tumors. While weakly expressed in most tumors, focal amplification coincided with strong OVAL transcriptional activation. Screening of 16 other cancer types revealed similar patterns in serous endometrial carcinomas. This shows that intergenic lncRNAs can be specifically targeted by somatic copy-number amplification, suggestive of functional involvement in tumor initiation or progression. Our analysis provides testable hypotheses and paves the way for further study of lncRNAs based on TCGA and other large-scale cancer genomics datasets.'

aS'Uncovering the role of genomic "dark matter" in human disease.\r\nThe human genome encodes thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Although most remain functionally uncharacterized biological "dark matter," lncRNAs have garnered considerable attention for their diverse roles in human biology, including developmental programs and tumor suppressor gene networks. As the number of lncRNAs associated with human disease grows, ongoing research efforts are focusing on their regulatory mechanisms. New technologies that enable enumeration of lncRNA interaction partners and determination of lncRNA structure are well positioned to drive deeper understanding of their functions and involvement in pathogenesis. In turn, lncRNAs may become targets for therapeutic intervention or new tools for biotechnology.'

aS'The CASC15 Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA Locus Is Involved in Melanoma Progression and Phenotype Switching.\r\nIn recent years, considerable advances have been made in the characterization of protein-coding alterations involved in the pathogenesis of melanoma. However, despite their growing implication in cancer, little is known about the role of long noncoding RNAs in melanoma progression. We hypothesized that copy number alterations (CNAs) of intergenic nonprotein-coding domains could help identify long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) associated with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Among several candidates, our approach uncovered the chromosome 6p22.3 CASC15 (cancer susceptibility candidate 15) lincRNA locus as a frequently gained genomic segment in metastatic melanoma tumors and cell lines. The locus was actively transcribed in metastatic melanoma cells, and upregulation of CASC15 expression was associated with metastatic progression to brain metastasis in a mouse xenograft model. In clinical specimens, CASC15 levels increased during melanoma progression and were independent predictors of disease recurrence in a cohort of 141 patients with AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage III lymph node metastasis. Moreover, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments revealed that CASC15 regulates melanoma cell phenotype switching between proliferative and invasive states. Accordingly, CASC15 levels correlated with known gene signatures corresponding to melanoma proliferative and invasive phenotypes. These findings support a key role for CASC15 in metastatic melanoma.'

aS'Genome-scale transcriptional activation by an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 complex.\r\nSystematic interrogation of gene function requires the ability to perturb gene expression in a robust and generalizable manner. Here we describe structure-guided engineering of a CRISPR-Cas9 complex to mediate efficient transcriptional activation at endogenous genomic loci. We used these engineered Cas9 activation complexes to investigate single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation, to demonstrate multiplexed activation of ten genes simultaneously, and to upregulate long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) transcripts. We also synthesized a library consisting of 70,290 guides targeting all human RefSeq coding isoforms to screen for genes that, upon activation, confer resistance to a BRAF inhibitor. The top hits included genes previously shown to be able to confer resistance, and novel candidates were validated using individual sgRNA and complementary DNA overexpression. A gene expression signature based on the top screening hits correlated with markers of BRAF inhibitor resistance in cell lines and patient-derived samples. These results collectively demonstrate the potential of Cas9-based activators as a powerful genetic perturbation technology.'

aS'A LncRNA-MAF:MAFB transcription factor network regulates epidermal differentiation.\r\nProgenitor differentiation requires remodeling of genomic expression; however, in many tissues, such as epidermis, the spectrum of remodeled genes and the transcription factors (TFs) that control them are not fully defined. We performed kinetic transcriptome analysis during regeneration of differentiated epidermis and identified gene sets enriched in progenitors (594 genes), in early (159 genes), and in late differentiation (387 genes). Module mapping of 1,046 TFs identified MAF and MAFB as necessary and sufficient for progenitor differentiation. MAF:MAFB regulated 393 genes altered in this setting. Integrative analysis identified ANCR and TINCR lncRNAs as essential upstream MAF:MAFB regulators. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated MAF:MAFB binding to known epidermal differentiation TF genes whose expression they controlled, including GRHL3, ZNF750, KLF4, and PRDM1. Each of these TFs rescued expression of specific MAF:MAFB target gene subsets in the setting of MAF:MAFB loss, indicating they act downstream of MAF:MAFB. A lncRNA-TF network is thus essential for epidermal differentiation.'

aS'The microRNAs within the DLK1-DIO3 genomic region: involvement in disease pathogenesis.\r\nThe mammalian genome is transcribed in a developmentally regulated manner, generating RNA strands ranging from long to short non-coding RNA (ncRNAs). NcRNAs generated by intergenic sequences and protein-coding loci, represent up to 98 % of the human transcriptome. Non-coding transcripts comprise short ncRNAs such as microRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs and long intergenic RNAs, most of which exercise a strictly controlled negative regulation of expression of protein-coding genes. In humans, the DLK1-DIO3 genomic region, located on human chromosome 14 (14q32) contains the paternally expressed imprinted genes DLK1, RTL1, and DIO3 and the maternally expressed imprinted genes MEG3 (Gtl2), MEG8 (RIAN), and antisense RTL1 (asRTL1). This region hosts, in addition to two long intergenic RNAs, the MEG3 and MEG8, one of the largest microRNA clusters in the genome, with 53 miRNAs in the forward strand and one (mir-1247) in the reverse strand. Many of these miRNAs are differentially expressed in several pathologic processes and various cancers. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic importance of the DLK1-DIO3 domain-containing microRNA cluster may contribute to innovative therapeutic strategies in a range of diseases. Here we present an in-depth review of this vital genomic region, and examine the role the microRNAs of this region may play in controlling tissue homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of some human diseases, mostly cancer, when aberrantly expressed. The potential clinical implications of this data are also discussed.'

aS'Long Non-Coding RNA Expression during Aging in the Human Subependymal Zone.\r\nThe human subependymal zone (SEZ) is debatably a source of newly born neurons throughout life and neurogenesis is a multi-step process requiring distinct transcripts during cell proliferation and early neuronal maturation, along with orchestrated changes in gene expression during cell state/fate transitions. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that the majority of our genome that results in production of non-protein-coding RNAs plays vital roles in the evolution, development, adaptation, and region-specific function of the human brain. We predicted that some transcripts expressed in the SEZ may be unique to this specialized brain region, and that a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of this region would aid in defining expression changes during neuronal birth and growth in adult humans. Here, we used deep RNA sequencing of human SEZ tissue during adulthood and aging to characterize the transcriptional landscape with a particular emphasis on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The data show predicted age-related changes in mRNAs encoding proliferation, progenitor, and inflammatory proteins as well as a unique subset of lncRNAs that are highly expressed in the human SEZ, many of which have unknown functions. Our results suggest the existence of robust proliferative and neuronal differentiation potential in the adult human SEZ and lay the foundation for understanding the involvement of lncRNAs in postnatal neurogenesis and potentially associated neurodevelopmental diseases that emerge after birth.'

aS'Predicting the functions of long noncoding RNAs using RNA-seq based on Bayesian network.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes. However, functions of most lncRNAs are poorly characterized. Here, we represent a framework to predict functions of lncRNAs through construction of a regulatory network between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes. Using RNA-seq data, the transcript profiles of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes are constructed. Using the Bayesian network method, a regulatory network, which implies dependency relations between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes, was built. In combining protein interaction network, highly connected coding genes linked by a given lncRNA were subsequently used to predict functions of the lncRNA through functional enrichment. Application of our method to prostate RNA-seq data showed that 762 lncRNAs in the constructed regulatory network were assigned functions. We found that lncRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes, such as tissue development or embryo development (e.g., nervous system development and mesoderm development). By comparison with functions inferred using the neighboring gene-based method and functions determined using lncRNA knockdown experiments, our method can provide comparable predicted functions of lncRNAs. Overall, our method can be applied to emerging RNA-seq data, which will help researchers identify complex relations between lncRNAs and coding genes and reveal important functions of lncRNAs.'

aS'LncRNA NALT interaction with NOTCH1 promoted cell proliferation in pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\r\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) was referred to be participating in various malignant tumors. Location based analysis of the mechanism in lncRNA and genes have been highly focused. In this study, we reported that lncRNA named NALT which was located near NOTCH1 within 100\xe2\x80\x89bp away. We confirmed that up-regulation of NALT associating with NOTCH1 in human samples. Increased expression of NALT dramatically promoted cell proliferation in cell lines via CCK8 assay and EDU stain. Further xenograft tumor also indicated the growth inducing affection of NALT while could be partial reversed by GSI. Besides, through sorting the side-population cells in T ALL cells treated with NALT shRNA could decrease percentage of SP cell which companied by the down-regulation of NOTCH1. Gal4-\xce\xbbN/BoxB reporter system revealed that the nuclear located NALT could function as a transcription activator which caused an activation of NOTCH signal pathway as confirmed by western blot. Taken together, we found a neighbor of NOTCH1, Lnc-RP11-611D20.2 (named NALT) which could regulate the NOTCH1 signal pathway through cis-regulation. This founding may trigger a comparable development of diagnosis or novel molecularly-directed therapies.'

Myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT) is identified as lncRNAs, which is involved in various diseases, pathological and physiological processes, such as myocardial infarction, diabetic retinopathy, paranoid schizophrenia, microvascular dysfunction and formation of nuclear bodies, and neurogenic commitment.

aS'SRP RNA provides the physiologically essential GTPase activation function in cotranslational protein targeting.\r\nThe signal recognition particle (SRP) cotranslationally targets proteins to cell membranes by coordinated binding and release of ribosome-associated nascent polypeptides and a membrane-associated SRP receptor. GTP uptake and hydrolysis by the SRP-receptor complex govern this targeting cycle. Because no GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) are known for the SRP and SRP receptor GTPases, however, it has been unclear whether and how GTP hydrolysis is stimulated during protein trafficking in vivo. Using both biochemical and genetic experiments, we show here that SRP RNA enhances GTPase activity of the SRP-receptor complex above a critical threshold required for cell viability. Furthermore, this stimulation is a property of the SRP RNA tetraloop. SRP RNA tetraloop mutants that confer defective growth phenotypes can assemble into SRP-receptor complexes, but fail to stimulate GTP hydrolysis in these complexes in vitro. Tethered hydroxyl radical probing data reveal that specific positioning of the RNA tetraloop within the SRP-receptor complex is required to stimulate GTPase activity to a level sufficient to support cell growth. These results explain why no external GAP is needed and why the phylogenetically conserved SRP RNA tetraloop is required in vivo.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA expression profiles in hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia.\r\nHereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominantly inherited vascular disease characterized by the presence of mucocutaneous telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations in visceral organs. HHT is predominantly caused by mutations in ENG and ACVRL1, which both belong to the TGF-\xce\xb2 signalling pathway. The exact mechanism of how haploinsufficiency of ENG and ACVRL1 leads to HHT manifestations remains to be identified. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as key regulators of gene expression and constitute a sizable fraction of the human transcriptome, we wanted to assess whether lncRNAs play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of HHT manifestations. By microarray technology, we profiled lncRNA transcripts from HHT nasal telangiectasial and non-telangiectasial tissue using a paired design. The microarray probes were annotated using the GENCODE v.16 dataset, identifying 4,810 probes mapping to 2,811 lncRNAs. Comparing HHT telangiectasial tissue with HHT non-telangiectasial tissue, we identified 42 lncRNAs that are differentially expressed (q&lt;0.001). Using GREAT, a tool that assumes cis-regulation, we showed that differently expressed lncRNAs are enriched for genomic loci involved in key pathways concerning HHT. Our study identified lncRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in HHT telangiectasia and indicates that lncRNAs may contribute to regulate protein-coding loci in HHT. These results suggest that the lncRNA component of the transcriptome deserves more attention in HHT. A deeper understanding of lncRNAs and their role in telangiectasia formation possesses potential for discovering therapeutic targets in HHT.'

aS"Dlx genes pattern mammalian jaw primordium by regulating both lower jaw-specific and upper jaw-specific genetic programs.\r\nDlx transcription factors are implicated in patterning the mammalian jaw, based on their nested expression patterns in the first branchial arch (primordium for jaw) and mutant phenotypes; inactivation of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (Dlx1/2-/-) causes defects in the upper jaw, whereas Dlx5/6(-/-) results in homeotic transformation of the lower jaw into upper jaw. Therefore, the 'Dlx codes' appear to regionalize the jaw primordium such that Dlx1/2 regulate upper jaw development, while Dlx5/6 confer the lower jaw fate. Towards identifying the genetic pathways downstream of Dlx5/6, we compared the gene expression profiles of the wild-type and Dlx5/6(-/-) mouse mandibular arch (prospective lower jaw). We identified 20 previously unrecognized Dlx5/6-downstream genes, of which 12 were downregulated and 8 upregulated in the mutant. We found a Dlx-regulated transcriptional enhancer in close proximity to Gbx2, one of the Dlx5/6-downstream genes, strongly suggesting that Gbx2 is a direct target of Dlx5/6. We also showed that Pou3f3 is normally expressed in the maxillary (prospective upper jaw) but not mandibular arch, is upregulated in the mandibular arch of Dlx5/6(-/-), and is essential for formation of some of the maxillary arch-derived skeleton. A comparative analysis of the morphological and molecular phenotypes of various Dlx single and double mutants revealed that Dlx1, 2, 5 and 6 act both partially redundantly and antagonistically to direct differential expression of downstream genes in each domain of the first branchial arch. We propose a new model for Dlx-mediated mammalian jaw patterning."

aS'Bidirectional expression of CUG and CAG expansion transcripts and intranuclear polyglutamine inclusions in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8.\r\nWe previously reported that a (CTG)n expansion causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8), a slowly progressive ataxia with reduced penetrance. We now report a transgenic mouse model in which the full-length human SCA8 mutation is transcribed using its endogenous promoter. (CTG)116 expansion, but not (CTG)11 control lines, develop a progressive neurological phenotype with in vivo imaging showing reduced cerebellar-cortical inhibition. 1C2-positive intranuclear inclusions in cerebellar Purkinje and brainstem neurons in SCA8 expansion mice and human SCA8 autopsy tissue result from translation of a polyglutamine protein, encoded on a previously unidentified antiparallel transcript (ataxin 8, ATXN8) spanning the repeat in the CAG direction. The neurological phenotype in SCA8 BAC expansion but not BAC control lines demonstrates the pathogenicity of the (CTG-CAG)n expansion. Moreover, the expression of noncoding (CUG)n expansion transcripts (ataxin 8 opposite strand, ATXN8OS) and the discovery of intranuclear polyglutamine inclusions suggests SCA8 pathogenesis involves toxic gain-of-function mechanisms at both the protein and RNA levels.'

aS'Beta-globin intergenic transcription and histone acetylation dependent on an enhancer.\r\nHistone acetyltransferases are associated with the elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex, supporting the idea that histone acetylation and transcription are intertwined mechanistically in gene coding sequences. Here, we studied the establishment and function of histone acetylation and transcription in noncoding sequences by using a model locus linking the beta-globin HS2 enhancer and the embryonic epsilon-globin gene in chromatin. An intact HS2 enhancer that recruits RNA Pol II is required for intergenic transcription and histone H3 acetylation and K4 methylation between the enhancer and target gene. RNA Pol II recruitment to the target gene TATA box is not required for the intergenic transcription or intergenic histone modifications, strongly implying that they are properties conferred by the enhancer. However, Pol II recruitment at HS2, intergenic transcription, and intergenic histone modification are not sufficient for transcription or modification of the target gene: these changes require initiation at the TATA box of the gene. The results suggest that intergenic and genic transcription complexes are independent and possibly differ from one another.'

aS"A CTCF-binding silencer regulates the imprinted genes AWT1 and WT1-AS and exhibits sequential epigenetic defects during Wilms' tumourigenesis.\r\nWe have shown previously that AWT1 and WT1-AS are functionally imprinted in human kidney. In the adult kidney, expression of both transcripts is restricted to the paternal allele, with the silent maternal allele retaining methylation at the WT1 antisense regulatory region (WT1 ARR). Here, we report characterization of the WT1 ARR differentially methylated region and show that it contains a transcriptional silencer element acting on both the AWT1 and WT1-AS promoters. DNA methylation of the silencer results in increased transcriptional repression, and the silencer is also shown to be an in vitro and in vivo target site for the imprinting regulator protein CTCF. Binding of CTCF is methylation-sensitive and limited to the unmethylated silencer. Potentiation of the silencer activity is demonstrated after CTCF protein is knocked down, suggesting a novel silencer-blocking activity for CTCF. We also report assessment of WT1 ARR methylation in developmental and tumour tissues, including the first analysis of Wilms' tumour precursor lesions, nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests show increases in methylation levels relative to foetal kidney and reductions relative to the adult kidney, together with biallelic expression of AWT1 and WT1-AS. Notably, the methylation status of CpG residues within the CTCF target site appears to distinguish monoallelic and biallelic expression states. Our data suggest that failure of methylation spreading at the WT1 ARR early in renal development, followed by imprint erasure, occurs during Wilms' tumourigenesis. We propose a model wherein imprinting defects at chromosome 11p13 may contribute to Wilms' tumourigenesis."

aS'Fine-scale chromatin interaction maps reveal the cis-regulatory landscape of human lincRNA genes.\r\nHigh-throughput methods based on chromosome conformation capture have greatly advanced our understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes but are limited in resolution by their reliance on restriction enzymes. Here we describe a method called DNase Hi-C for comprehensively mapping global chromatin contacts. DNase Hi-C uses DNase I for chromatin fragmentation, leading to greatly improved efficiency and resolution over that of Hi-C. Coupling this method with DNA-capture technology provides a high-throughput approach for targeted mapping of fine-scale chromatin architecture. We applied targeted DNase Hi-C to characterize the 3D organization of 998 large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) promoters in two human cell lines. Our results revealed that expression of lincRNAs is tightly controlled by complex mechanisms involving both super-enhancers and the Polycomb repressive complex. Our results provide the first glimpse of the cell type-specific 3D organization of lincRNA genes.'

aS"Identification of a long non-coding RNA-associated RNP complex regulating metastasis at the translational step.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a novel class of regulatory genes that play critical roles in various processes ranging from normal development to human diseases such as cancer progression. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs regulate the gene expression by chromatin remodelling, transcription, splicing and RNA decay control, enhancer function, and epigenetic regulation. However, little is known about translation regulation by lncRNAs. We identified a translational regulatory lncRNA (treRNA) through genome-wide computational analysis. We found that treRNA is upregulated in paired clinical breast cancer primary and lymph-node metastasis samples, and that its expression stimulates tumour invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, we found that treRNA downregulates the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin by suppressing the translation of its mRNA. We identified a novel ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, consisting of RNA-binding proteins (hnRNP K, FXR1, and FXR2), PUF60 and SF3B3, that is required for this treRNA functions. Translational suppression by treRNA is dependent on the 3'UTR of the E-cadherin mRNA. Taken together, our study indicates a novel mechanism of gene regulation by lncRNAs in cancer progression."

aS'Comparative analysis of the primate X-inactivation center region and reconstruction of the ancestral primate XIST locus.\r\nHere we provide a detailed comparative analysis across the candidate X-Inactivation Center (XIC) region and the XIST locus in the genomes of six primates and three mammalian outgroup species. Since lemurs and other strepsirrhine primates represent the sister lineage to all other primates, this analysis focuses on lemurs to reconstruct the ancestral primate sequences and to gain insight into the evolution of this region and the genes within it. This comparative evolutionary genomics approach reveals significant expansion in genomic size across the XIC region in higher primates, with minimal size alterations across the XIST locus itself. Reconstructed primate ancestral XIC sequences show that the most dramatic changes during the past 80 million years occurred between the ancestral primate and the lineage leading to Old World monkeys. In contrast, the XIST locus compared between human and the primate ancestor does not indicate any dramatic changes to exons or XIST-specific repeats; rather, evolution of this locus reflects small incremental changes in overall sequence identity and short repeat insertions. While this comparative analysis reinforces that the region around XIST has been subject to significant genomic change, even among primates, our data suggest that evolution of the XIST sequences themselves represents only small lineage-specific changes across the past 80 million years.'

aS'Gene Coexpression Networks in Human Brain Developmental Transcriptomes Implicate the Association of Long Noncoding RNAs with Intellectual Disability.\r\nThe advent of next-generation sequencing for genetic diagnoses of complex developmental disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID), has facilitated the identification of hundreds of predisposing genetic variants. However, there still exists a vast gap in our knowledge of causal genetic factors for ID as evidenced by low diagnostic yield of genetic screening, in which identifiable genetic causes are not found for the majority of ID cases. Most methods of genetic screening focus on protein-coding genes; however, noncoding RNAs may outnumber protein-coding genes and play important roles in brain development. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) specifically have been shown to be enriched in the brain and have diverse roles in gene regulation at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. LncRNAs are a vastly uncharacterized group of noncoding genes, which could function in brain development and harbor ID-predisposing genetic variants. We analyzed lncRNAs for coexpression with known ID genes and affected biological pathways within a weighted gene coexpression network derived from RNA-sequencing data spanning human brain development. Several ID-associated gene modules were found to be enriched for lncRNAs, known ID genes, and affected biological pathways. Utilizing a list of de novo and pathogenic copy number variants detected in ID probands, we identified lncRNAs overlapping these genetic structural variants. By integrating our results, we have made a prioritized list of potential ID-associated lncRNAs based on the developing brain gene coexpression network and genetic structural variants found in ID probands.'

aS'The lncRNA DEANR1 facilitates human endoderm differentiation by activating FOXA2 expression.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes, including cell lineage specification. Here, we report transcriptome profiling of human endoderm and pancreatic cell lineages using purified cell populations. Analysis of the data sets allows us to identify hundreds of lncRNAs that exhibit differentiation-stage-specific expression patterns. As a first step in characterizing these lncRNAs, we focus on an endoderm-specific lncRNA, definitive\xc2\xa0endoderm-associated lncRNA1 (DEANR1), and demonstrate that it plays an important role in human endoderm differentiation. DEANR1 contributes to endoderm differentiation by positively regulating expression of the endoderm factor FOXA2. Importantly, overexpression of FOXA2 is able to rescue endoderm differentiation defects caused by\xc2\xa0DEANR1 depletion. Mechanistically, DEANR1 facilitates FOXA2 activation by facilitating SMAD2/3 recruitment to the FOXA2 promoter. Thus, our study\xc2\xa0not only reveals a large set of differentiation-stage-specific lncRNAs but also characterizes a functional lncRNA that is important for endoderm differentiation.'

However, the molecular identities, functional roles and localization dynamics of lncRNAs that influence nuclear architecture remain poorly understood. Here, we describe one lncRNA, Firre, that interacts with the nuclear-matrix factor hnRNPU through a 156-bp repeating sequence and localizes across an ~5-Mb domain on the X chromosome. We further observed Firre localization across five distinct trans-chromosomal loci, which reside in spatial proximity to the Firre genomic locus on the X chromosome. Both genetic deletion of the Firre locus and knockdown of hnRNPU resulted in loss of colocalization of these trans-chromosomal interacting loci. Thus, our data suggest a model in which lncRNAs such as Firre can interface with and modulate nuclear architecture across chromosomes.'

aS'Identification and characterization of novel genotoxic stress-inducible nuclear long noncoding RNAs in mammalian cells.\r\nWhole transcriptome analyses have revealed a large number of novel transcripts including long and short noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Currently, there is great interest in characterizing the functions of the different classes of ncRNAs and their relevance to cellular processes. In particular, nuclear long ncRNAs may be involved in controlling various aspects of biological regulation, such as stress responses. By a combination of bioinformatic and experimental approaches, we identified 25 novel nuclear long ncRNAs from 6,088,565 full-length human cDNA sequences. Some nuclear long ncRNAs were conserved among vertebrates, whereas others were found only among primates. Expression profiling of the nuclear long ncRNAs in human tissues revealed that most were expressed ubiquitously. A subset of the identified nuclear long ncRNAs was induced by the genotoxic agents mitomycin C or doxorubicin, in HeLa Tet-off cells. There were no commonly altered nuclear long ncRNAs between mitomycin C- and doxorubicin-treated cells. These results suggest that distinct sets of nuclear long ncRNAs play roles in cellular defense mechanisms against specific genotoxic agents, and that particular long ncRNAs have the potential to be surrogate indicators of a specific cell stress.'

aS'A nomenclature for all signal recognition particle RNAs.\r\nThe signal recognition particle (SRP) is a cytosolic ribonucleoprotein complex that guides secretory proteins to biological membranes in all organisms. The SRP RNA is at the center of the structure and function of the SRP. The comparison of the growing number of SRP RNA sequences provides a rich source for gaining valuable insight into the composition, assembly, and phylogeny of the SRP. In order to assist in the continuation of these studies, we propose an SRP RNA nomenclature applicable to the three divisions of life.'

aS'LncRNAWiki: harnessing community knowledge in collaborative curation of human long non-coding RNAs.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) perform a diversity of functions in numerous important biological processes and are implicated in many human diseases. In this report we present lncRNAWiki (http://lncrna.big.ac.cn), a wiki-based platform that is open-content and publicly editable and aimed at community-based curation and collection of information on human lncRNAs. Current related databases are dependent primarily on curation by experts, making it laborious to annotate the exponentially accumulated information on lncRNAs, which inevitably requires collective efforts in community-based curation of lncRNAs. Unlike existing databases, lncRNAWiki features comprehensive integration of information on human lncRNAs obtained from multiple different resources and allows not only existing lncRNAs to be edited, updated and curated by different users but also the addition of newly identified lncRNAs by any user. It harnesses community collective knowledge in collecting, editing and annotating human lncRNAs and rewards community-curated efforts by providing explicit authorship based on quantified contributions. LncRNAWiki relies on the underling knowledge of scientific community for collective and collaborative curation of human lncRNAs and thus has the potential to serve as an up-to-date and comprehensive knowledgebase for human lncRNAs.'

aS'starBase v2.0: decoding miRNA-ceRNA, miRNA-ncRNA and protein-RNA interaction networks from large-scale CLIP-Seq data.\r\nAlthough microRNAs (miRNAs), other non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (e.g. lncRNAs, pseudogenes and circRNAs) and competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) have been implicated in cell-fate determination and in various human diseases, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory interaction networks among the multiple classes of RNAs. In this study, we developed starBase v2.0 (http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/) to systematically identify the RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interaction networks from 108 CLIP-Seq (PAR-CLIP, HITS-CLIP, iCLIP, CLASH) data sets generated by 37 independent studies. By analyzing millions of RNA-binding protein binding sites, we identified \xe2\x88\xbc9000 miRNA-circRNA, 16 000 miRNA-pseudogene and 285,000 protein-RNA regulatory relationships. Moreover, starBase v2.0 has been updated to provide the most comprehensive CLIP-Seq experimentally supported miRNA-mRNA and miRNA-lncRNA interaction networks to date. We identified \xe2\x88\xbc10,000 ceRNA pairs from CLIP-supported miRNA target sites. By combining 13 functional genomic annotations, we developed miRFunction and ceRNAFunction web servers to predict the function of miRNAs and other ncRNAs from the miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. Finally, we developed interactive web implementations to provide visualization, analysis and downloading of the aforementioned large-scale data sets. This study will greatly expand our understanding of ncRNA functions and their coordinated regulatory networks.'

aS'The making of a Barr body: the mosaic of factors that eXIST on the mammalian inactive X chromosome.\r\nDuring X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), nearly an entire X chromosome is permanently silenced and converted into a Barr body, providing dosage compensation for eutherians between the sexes. XCI is facilitated by the upregulation of the long non-coding RNA gene, XIST, which coats its chromosome of origin, recruits heterochromatin factors, and silences gene expression. During XCI, at least two distinct types of heterochromatin are established, and in this review we discuss the enrichment of facultative heterochromatin marks such as H3K27me3, H2AK119ub, and macroH2A as well as pericentric heterochromatin marks such as HP1, H3K9me3, and H4K20me3. The extremely stable maintenance of silencing is a product of reinforcing interactions within and between these domains. This paper "Xplores" the current knowledge of the pathways involved in XCI, how the pathways interact, and the gaps in our understanding that need to be filled.'

aS'Comparison of long noncoding RNA and mRNA expression profiles in mesenchymal stem cells derived from human periodontal ligament and bone marrow.\r\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in different anatomic locations possess diverse biological activities. Maintaining the pluripotent state and differentiation depend on the expression and regulation of thousands of genes, but it remains unclear which molecular mechanisms underlie MSC diversity. Thus, potential MSC applications are restricted. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in the complex molecular circuitry of cellular processes. We investigated differences in lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles between bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) with lncRNA microarray assays and bioinformatics analysis. In PDLSCs, numerous lncRNAs were significantly upregulated (n = 457) or downregulated (n = 513) compared to BMSCs. Furthermore, 1,578 mRNAs were differentially expressed. These genes implicated cellular pathways that may be associated with MSC characteristics, including apoptosis, MAPK, cell cycle, and Wnt signaling pathway. Signal-net analysis indicated that phospholipase C beta 4, filamin B beta, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma, and the ionotropic glutamate receptor, AMPA 1, had the highest betweenness centrality among significant genes in the differential gene profile network. A comparison between the coding-noncoding gene coexpression networks of PDLSCs and BMSCs identified chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 as a core regulatory factor in MSC biology. These results provided insight into the mechanisms underlying MSC biology.'

aS'A common set of distinct features that characterize noncoding RNAs across multiple species.\r\nTo find signature features shared by various ncRNA sub-types and characterize novel ncRNAs, we have developed a method, RNAfeature, to investigate &gt;600 sets of genomic and epigenomic data with various evolutionary and biophysical scores. RNAfeature utilizes a fine-tuned intra-species wrapper algorithm that is followed by a novel feature selection strategy across species. It considers long distance effect of certain features (e.g. histone modification at the promoter region). We finally narrow down on 10 informative features (including sequences, structures, expression profiles and epigenetic signals). These features are complementary to each other and as a whole can accurately distinguish canonical ncRNAs from CDSs and UTRs (accuracies: &gt;92% in human, mouse, worm and fly). Moreover, the feature pattern is conserved across multiple species. For instance, the supervised 10-feature model derived from animal species can predict ncRNAs in Arabidopsis (accuracy: 82%). Subsequently, we integrate the 10 features to define a set of noncoding potential scores, which can identify, evaluate and characterize novel noncoding RNAs. The score covers all transcribed regions (including unconserved ncRNAs), without requiring assembly of the full-length transcripts. Importantly, the noncoding potential allows us to identify and characterize potential functional domains with feature patterns similar to canonical ncRNAs (e.g. tRNA, snRNA, miRNA, etc) on \xe2\x88\xbc70% of human long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).'

aS"SCA8 mRNA expression suggests an antisense regulation of KLHL1 and correlates to SCA8 pathology.\r\nAn increasing number of inherited neurodegenerative diseases are known to be caused by the expansion of unstable trinucleotide repeat tracts. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) has been identified as being partly caused by a CTG expansion in an untranslated, endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1) gene. Clinically, SCA8 patients show similar features to those with the other SCAs, including limb and truncal ataxia, ataxic dysarthria and horizontal nystagmus, all of which are signs of dysfunction of the cerebellar system. However, allele sizes within the SCA8 proposed pathogenic range have been reported in patients with ataxia of unknown etiology, in individuals from pedigrees with other SCA or Friedreich's ataxia, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia or parkinsonism. These observations suggest that mutation of the SCA8 locus might affect neurons other than the cerebellum. Antisense transcripts are known to regulate complementary sense transcripts and are involved in several biologic functions, such as development, adaptive response, and viral infection. In order to test whether SCA8 affects the KLHL1 expression by antisense RNA in brain cells, we examined the expression pattern of KLHL1 and SCA8 in human tissues and in mouse brain regions. SCA8 expression was colocalized with KLHL1 transcript in many brain regions whose functions are correlated to the clinical symptoms of SCA8 patients. These findings lead to the hypothesis of a possible relevance that SCA8 transcript downregulates KLHL1 expression through an antisense mechanism, which then leads to SCA8 neuropathogenesis."

aS'Extracellular vesicle long noncoding RNA as potential biomarkers of liver cancer.\r\nAnalysis of extracellular vesicles (EV) and their contents may be useful as disease biomarkers if they reflect the contents of cells of origin, differ between normal and diseased tissue and can be reliably detected. An increasing number of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) are being reported to be aberrantly expressed in human cancers. These tumor-associated lncRNA may have potential as new biomarkers of disease. In this review, we highlight lncRNAs that are commonly associated with hepatocellular cancer, and summarize their potential biological roles and underlying molecular mechanisms. While lncRNA can be detected in the circulation, their low expression within circulating vesicles will require the use of highly sensitive detection technologies such as digital polymerase chain reaction or next-generation sequencing. While the integrity and functional role of tumor-specific lncRNAs within EV have yet to be established, their presence or enrichment within tumor cell-derived EV offers promise for their potential as disease biomarkers.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) promotes cell proliferation and migration by upregulating angiomotin gene expression in human osteosarcoma cells.\r\nThe long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) has a role in cell proliferation and migration. Angiomotin, encoded by the AMOT gene, is a protein that regulates the migration and organization of endothelial cells. SNHG12 and AMOT have been shown to play a role in a variety of human cancers but have yet to be studied in detail in human osteosarcoma. Tissue samples from primary osteosarcoma (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920) and adjacent normal tissues (n\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8920), the osteosarcoma cell lines, SAOS-2, MG-63, U-2 OS, and the human osteoblast cell line hFOB (OB3) were studied using Western blot for angiomotin, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of SNHG12 and AMOT. The expression of SNHG12 was knocked down using RNA interference. Cell migration assays were performed. Cell apoptosis was studied using flow cytometry. SNHG12 and AMOT messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines when compared with normal tissues and cells. Upregulation of AMOT mRNA was associated with upregulation of SNHG12. Knockdown of SNHG12 reduced the expression of angiomotin in osteosarcoma cells and suppressed cell proliferation and migration but did not affect cell apoptosis. This preliminary study has shown that the lncRNA SNHG12 promotes cell proliferation and migration by upregulating AMOT gene expression in osteosarcoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Further studies are recommended to investigate the role of SNHG12 and AMOT expression in tumor cell proliferation and migration and angiogenesis in osteosarcoma and a range of malignant mesenchymal tumors.'

aS'Noncoding RNA synthesis and loss of Polycomb group repression accompanies the colinear activation of the human HOXA cluster.\r\nThe ratio of noncoding to protein coding DNA rises with the complexity of the organism, culminating in nearly 99% of nonprotein coding DNA in humans. Nevertheless, a large portion of these regions is transcribed, creating the alleged paradox that noncoding RNA (ncRNA) represents the largest output of the human genome. Such a complex scenario may include epigenetic mechanisms where ncRNAs would be involved in chromatin regulation. We have investigated the intergenic, noncoding transcriptomes of mammalian HOX clusters. We show that "opposite strand transcription" from the intergenic spacer regions in the human HOXA cluster correlates with the activity state of adjacent HOXA genes. This noncoding transcription is regulated by the retinoic acid morphogen and follows the colinear activation pattern of the cluster. Opening of the cluster at sites of activation of intergenic transcripts is accompanied by changes in histone modifications and a loss of interaction with Polycomb group (PcG) repressive complexes. We propose that noncoding transcription is of fundamental importance for the opening and maintenance of the active state of HOX clusters.'

aS"Alternately spliced WT1 antisense transcripts interact with WT1 sense RNA and show epigenetic and splicing defects in cancer.\r\nMany mammalian genes contain overlapping antisense RNAs, but the functions and mechanisms of action of these transcripts are mostly unknown. WT1 is a well-characterized developmental gene that is mutated in Wilms' tumor (WT) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and has an antisense transcript (WT1-AS), which we have previously found to regulate WT1 protein levels. In this study, we show that WT1-AS is present in multiple spliceoforms that are usually expressed in parallel with WT1 RNA in human and mouse tissues. We demonstrate that the expression of WT1-AS correlates with methylation of the antisense regulatory region (ARR) in WT1 intron 1, displaying imprinted monoallelic expression in normal kidney and loss of imprinting in WT. However, we find no evidence for imprinting of mouse Wt1-as. WT1-AS transcripts are exported into the cytoplasm and form heteroduplexes with WT1 mRNA in the overlapping region in WT1 exon 1. In AML, there is often abnormal splicing of WT1-AS, which may play a role in the development of this malignancy. These results show that WT1 encodes conserved antisense RNAs that may have an important regulatory role in WT1 expression via RNA:RNA interactions, and which can become deregulated by a variety of mechanisms in cancer."

aS'The GENCODE v7 catalog of human long noncoding RNAs: analysis of their gene structure, evolution, and expression.\r\nThe human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.'

aS'Genome-wide profiling of p53-regulated enhancer RNAs uncovers a subset of enhancers controlled by a lncRNA.\r\np53 binds enhancers to regulate key target genes. Here, we globally mapped p53-regulated enhancers by looking at enhancer RNA (eRNA) production. Intriguingly, while many p53-induced enhancers contained p53-binding sites, most did not. As long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are prominent regulators of chromatin dynamics, we hypothesized that p53-induced lncRNAs contribute to the activation of enhancers by p53. Among p53-induced lncRNAs, we identified LED and demonstrate that its suppression attenuates p53 function. Chromatin-binding and eRNA expression analyses show that LED associates with and activates strong enhancers. One prominent target of LED was located at an enhancer region within CDKN1A gene, a potent p53-responsive cell cycle inhibitor. LED knockdown reduces CDKN1A enhancer induction and activity, and cell cycle arrest following p53 activation. Finally, promoter-associated hypermethylation analysis shows silencing of LED in human tumours. Thus, our study identifies a new layer of complexity in the p53 pathway and suggests its dysregulation in cancer.'

aS'Genome-wide profiling to analyze the effects of Ox-LDL induced THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells on gene expression.\r\nAtherosclerosis has a high incidence and is harmful to human health. An elevated level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) is one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. During atherogenesis progression, circulating monocytes adhere to the intima and differentiate into macrophages. After differentiation, intimal macrophages intake Ox-LDL via scavenger receptors, thereby transforming into foam cells. Foam cell formation due to excessive accumulation of cholesterol by macrophages is a pathological hallmark of atherosclerosis. To gain a molecular understanding of the effect of Ox-LDL in atherosclerosis development, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of the Ox-LDL-induced macrophage transformation by microarray gene expression profiling. Here we describe in details the contents and quality controls for the gene expression and related results associated with the data uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number GSE54039).'

aS'Long Noncoding RNA Regulation of Pluripotency.\r\nPluripotent stem cells (PSCs) represent a unique kind of stem cell, as they are able to indefinitely self-renew and hold the potential to differentiate into any derivative of the three germ layers. As such, human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) and human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) provide a unique opportunity for studying the earliest steps of human embryogenesis and, at the same time, are of great therapeutic interest. The molecular mechanisms underlying pluripotency represent a major field of research. Recent evidence suggests that a complex network of transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and noncoding RNAs exist in pluripotent cells to regulate the balance between self-renewal and multilineage differentiation. Regulatory noncoding RNAs come in two flavors: short and long. The first class includes microRNAs (miRNAs), which are involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of cell cycle and differentiation in PSCs. Instead, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a heterogeneous group of long transcripts that regulate gene expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In this review, we focus on the role played by lncRNAs in the maintenance of pluripotency, emphasizing the interplay between lncRNAs and other pivotal regulators in PSCs.'

aS'Construction and analysis of lncRNA-lncRNA synergistic networks to reveal clinically relevant lncRNAs in cancer.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in diverse biological processes. Moreover, the development and progression of cancer often involves the combined actions of several lncRNAs. Here we propose a multi-step method for constructing lncRNA-lncRNA functional synergistic networks (LFSNs) through co-regulation of functional modules having three features: common coexpressed genes of lncRNA pairs, enrichment in the same functional category and close proximity within protein interaction networks. Applied to three cancers, we constructed cancer-specific LFSNs and found that they exhibit a scale free and modular architecture. In addition, cancer-associated lncRNAs tend to be hubs and are enriched within modules. Although there is little synergistic pairing of lncRNAs across cancers, lncRNA pairs involved in the same cancer hallmarks by regulating same or different biological processes. Finally, we identify prognostic biomarkers within cancer lncRNA expression datasets using modules derived from LFSNs. In summary, this proof-of-principle study indicates synergistic lncRNA pairs can be identified through integrative analysis of genome-wide expression data sets and functional information.'

aS'RNA-binding proteins in pluripotency, differentiation, and reprogramming.\r\nEmbryonic stem cell maintenance, differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming require the interplay of multiple pluripotency factors, epigenetic remodelers, and extracellular signaling pathways. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in a wide range of regulatory pathways, from RNA metabolism to epigenetic modifications. In recent years we have witnessed more and more studies on the discovery of new RBPs and the assessment of their functions in a variety of biological systems, including stem cells. We review the current studies on RBPs and focus on those that have functional implications in pluripotency, differentiation, and/or reprogramming in both the human and mouse systems.'

aS'The miR-545/374a cluster encoded in the Ftx lncRNA is overexpressed in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes tumorigenesis and tumor progression.\r\nHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have shown several long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play various roles in HCC progression, but no research has focused on the expression pattern of microRNA clusters encoded in lncRNAs. The Ftx gene encodes a lncRNA which harbors 2 clusters of microRNAs in its introns, the miR-374b/421 cluster and the miR-545/374a cluster. To date, no research has focused on the role of the miR-545/374a and miR-374b/421 clusters in HBV-related HCC. In this study, 66 pairs of HBV-related HCC tissue and matched non-cancerous liver tissue specimens were analyzed for the expression of the Ftx microRNA clusters. Our results showed that the miR-545/374a cluster was upregulated in HBV-HCC tissue and significantly correlated with prognosis-related clinical features, including histological grade, metastasis and tumor capsule. Transfection studies with microRNA mimics and inhibitors revealed that miR-545/374a expression promoted in vitro cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion. The wild-type HBV-genome-containing plasmid or full-length HBx protein encoding plasmid was transfected into the Bel-7402 cell line and observed for their influence on miR-545/374a expression. We found that transfection of the HBV genome or HBx alone resulted in an increase in miR-545/374a expression. Next, by monitoring the expression of sera miR-545/374a before and after surgical tumor excision, we found serum miR-545/374a was tumor-derived and exhibited a sharp decrease 25 days after tumor excision. We also examined the gender-based difference in miR-545/374a expression among HCC patients and utilized microRNA target prediction software to find the targets of miR-545/374a. One of these targets, namely estrogen-related receptor gamma (ESRRG) was inversely correlated with miR-545 expression. In conclusion, the overexpression of miR-545/374a cluster located in the Ftx lncRNA is partially responsible for a poor prognosis, and monitoring sera levels of miR-545/374a may be a useful diagnostic marker for HCC.'

aS'The landscape of long noncoding RNAs in the human transcriptome.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of tissue physiology and disease processes including cancer. To delineate genome-wide lncRNA expression, we curated 7,256 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from tumors, normal tissues and cell lines comprising over 43 Tb of sequence from 25 independent studies. We applied ab initio assembly methodology to this data set, yielding a consensus human transcriptome of 91,013 expressed genes. Over 68% (58,648) of genes were classified as lncRNAs, of which 79% were previously unannotated. About 1% (597) of the lncRNAs harbored ultraconserved elements, and 7% (3,900) overlapped disease-associated SNPs. To prioritize lineage-specific, disease-associated lncRNA expression, we employed non-parametric differential expression testing and nominated 7,942 lineage- or cancer-associated lncRNA genes. The lncRNA landscape characterized here may shed light on normal biology and cancer pathogenesis and may be valuable for future biomarker development.'

aS'Genome-wide differential expression of synaptic long noncoding RNAs in autism spectrum disorder.\r\nA genome-wide differential expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) was identified in blood specimens of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A total of 3929 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in ASD peripheral leukocytes, including 2407 that were upregulated and 1522 that were downregulated. Simultaneously, 2591 messenger RNAs (mRNAs), including 1789 upregulated and 821 downregulated, were also identified in ASD leukocytes. Functional pathway analysis of these lncRNAs revealed neurological pathways of the synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term depression and long-term potentiation to be primarily involved. Thirteen synaptic lncRNAs, including nine upregulated and four downregulated, and 19 synaptic mRNAs, including 12 upregulated and seven downregulated, were identified as being differentially expressed in ASD. Our identification of differential expression of synaptic lncRNAs and mRNAs suggested that synaptic vesicle transportation and cycling are important for the delivery of synaptosomal protein(s) between presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes in ASD. Finding of 19 lncRNAs, which are the antisense, bi-directional and intergenic, of HOX genes may lead us to investigate the role of HOX genes involved in the development of ASD. Discovery of the lncRNAs of SHANK2-AS and BDNF-AS, the natural antisense of genes SHANK2 and BDNF, respectively, indicates that in addition to gene mutations, deregulation of lncRNAs on ASD-causing gene loci presents a new approach for exploring possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying ASD. Our study also opened a new avenue for exploring the use of lncRNA(s) as biomarker(s) for the early detection of ASD.'

aS'Identification of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster noncoding RNAs as novel candidate biomarkers for liver tumor promotion.\r\nThe molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long-lasting perturbations of gene expression. Here, we have investigated the temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early stages of phenobarbital (PB) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo. Molecular profiling (mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], DNA methylation, and proteins) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster, a locus that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice and various neoplasms in humans. PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster noncoding RNA (ncRNA) Meg3 was localized to glutamine synthetase-positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes, suggesting a role for \xce\xb2-catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive androstane receptor and \xce\xb2-catenin pathways. Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic potential of novel compounds.'

aS'Comprehensive analysis of long non-coding RNAs in human breast cancer clinical subtypes.\r\nAccumulating evidence highlights the potential role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in solid tumors. However, the role of lncRNA expression in human breast cancer biology, prognosis and molecular classification remains unknown. Herein, we established the lncRNA profile of 658 infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We found lncRNA expression to correlate with the gene expression and chromatin landscape of human mammary epithelial cells (non-transformed) and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Unsupervised consensus clustering of lncRNA revealed four subgroups that displayed different prognoses. Gene set enrichment analysis for cis- and trans-acting lncRNAs showed enrichment for breast cancer signatures driven by master regulators of breast carcinogenesis. Interestingly, the lncRNA HOTAIR was significantly overexpressed in the HER2-enriched subgroup, while the lncRNA HOTAIRM1 was significantly overexpressed in the basal-like subgroup. Estrogen receptor (ESR1) expression was associated with distinct lncRNA networks in lncRNA clusters III and IV. Importantly, almost two thirds of the lncRNAs were marked by enhancer chromatin modifications (i.e., H3K27ac), suggesting that expressed lncRNA in breast cancer drives carcinogenesis through increased activity of neighboring genes. In summary, our study depicts the first lncRNA subtype classification in breast cancer and provides the framework for future studies to assess the interplay between lncRNAs and the breast cancer epigenome.'

aS'Long nuclear-retained non-coding RNAs and allele-specific higher-order chromatin organization at imprinted snoRNA gene arrays.\r\nThe imprinted Snurf-Snrpn domain, also referred to as the Prader-Willi syndrome region, contains two approximately 100-200 kb arrays of repeated small nucleolar (sno)RNAs processed from introns of long, paternally expressed non-protein-coding RNAs whose biogenesis and functions are poorly understood. We provide evidence that C/D snoRNAs do not derive from a single transcript as previously envisaged, but rather from (at least) two independent transcription units. We show that spliced snoRNA host-gene transcripts accumulate near their transcription sites as structurally constrained RNA species that are prevented from diffusing, as well as multiple stable nucleoplasmic RNA foci dispersed in the entire nucleus but not in the nucleolus. Chromatin structure at these repeated arrays displays an outstanding parent-of-origin-specific higher-order organization: the transcriptionally active allele is revealed as extended DNA FISH signals whereas the genetically identical, silent allele is visualized as singlet DNA FISH signals. A similar allele-specific chromatin organization is documented for snoRNA gene arrays at the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 domain. Our findings have repercussions for understanding the spatial organization of gene expression and the intra-nuclear fate of non-coding RNAs in the context of nuclear architecture.'

aS'Integrated analysis of dysregulated lncRNA expression in fetal cardiac tissues with ventricular septal defect.\r\nVentricular septal defects (VSD) are the most common form of congenital heart disease, which is the leading non-infectious cause of death in children; nevertheless, the exact cause of VSD is not yet fully understood. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play key roles in various biological processes, such as imprinting control, circuitry controlling pluripotency and differentiation, immune responses and chromosome dynamics. Notably, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in disease etiology, although an association with VSD has not been reported. In the present study, we conducted an integrated analysis of dysregulated lncRNAs, focusing specifically on the identification and characterization of lncRNAs potentially involving in initiation of VSD. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of cardiac tissues from VSD-affected and normal hearts was performed using a second-generation lncRNA microarray, which covers the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts (29,241 lncRNAs and 30,215 coding transcripts). In total, 880 lncRNAs were upregulated and 628 were downregulated in VSD. Furthermore, our established filtering pipeline indicated an association of two lncRNAs, ENST00000513542 and RP11-473L15.2, with VSD. This dysregulation of the lncRNA profile provides a novel insight into the etiology of VSD and furthermore, illustrates the intricate relationship between coding and ncRNA transcripts in cardiac development. These data may offer a background/reference resource for future functional studies of lncRNAs related to VSD.'

aS'Regulation of type III iodothyronine deiodinase expression in human cell lines.\r\nType I iodothyronine deiodinase (D1) and type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) catalyze the activation of the prohormone T4 to the active hormone T3; type III iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) catalyzes the inactivation of T4 and T3. D3 is highly expressed in brain, placenta, pregnant uterus, and fetal tissues and plays an important role in regulating thyroid hormone bioavailability during fetal development. We examined the activity of the different deiodinases in human cell lines and investigated the regulation of D3 activity and mRNA expression in these cell lines, as well as its possible coexpression with neighboring genes Dlk1 and Dio3os, which may also be especially important during development. D1 activity and mRNA were only found in HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells, and D2 activity was observed in none of the cell lines. D3 activity and mRNA was found in ECC-1 endometrium carcinoma cells, MCF-7 mammacarcinoma cells, WRL-68 embryonic liver cells, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, but not in the HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell line or in any choriocarcinoma or astrocytoma cell line. We demonstrated that the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate increased D3 activity 2- to 9-fold in ECC-1, MCF-7, WRL-68, and SH-SY5Y cells. Estradiol increased D3 activity 3-fold in ECC-1, but not in any other cells. Dexamethasone decreased D3 activity in WRL-68 cells only in the absence of fetal calf serum. Incubation with retinoids increased D3 activity 2- to 3-fold in ECC-1, WRL-68, and MCF-7 cells but decreased D3 activity in SH-SY5Y cells. D3 expression in the different cells was not affected by cAMP or thyroid hormone. Interestingly, D3 mRNA expression in the different cell lines strongly correlated with Dio3os mRNA expression and in a large set of neuroblastoma cell lines also with Dlk1 expression. In conclusion, we identified different human D3-expressing cell lines, in which the regulation of D3 expression is cell type-specific. Our data suggest that estradiol may be one of the factors contributing to the induction of D3 activity in the pregnant uterus and that in addition to gene-specific regulatory elements, more distant common regulatory elements also may be involved in the regulation of D3 expression.'

aS'Defining the Human Brain Proteome Using Transcriptomics and Antibody-Based Profiling with a Focus on the Cerebral Cortex.\r\nThe mammalian brain is a complex organ composed of many specialized cells, harboring sets of both common, widely distributed, as well as specialized and discretely localized proteins. Here we focus on the human brain, utilizing transcriptomics and public available Human Protein Atlas (HPA) data to analyze brain-enriched (frontal cortex) polyadenylated messenger RNA and long non-coding RNA and generate a genome-wide draft of global and cellular expression patterns of the brain. Based on transcriptomics analysis of altogether 27 tissues, we have estimated that approximately 3% (n=571) of all protein coding genes and 13% (n=87) of the long non-coding genes expressed in the human brain are enriched, having at least five times higher expression levels in brain as compared to any of the other analyzed peripheral tissues. Based on gene ontology analysis and detailed annotation using antibody-based tissue micro array analysis of the corresponding proteins, we found the majority of brain-enriched protein coding genes to be expressed in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes or in neurons with molecular properties linked to synaptic transmission and brain development. Detailed analysis of the transcripts and the genetic landscape of brain-enriched coding and non-coding genes revealed brain-enriched splice variants. Several clusters of neighboring brain-enriched genes were also identified, suggesting regulation of gene expression on the chromatin level. This multi-angle approach uncovered the brain-enriched transcriptome and linked genes to cell types and functions, providing novel insights into the molecular foundation of this highly specialized organ.'

aS"FAS-antisense 1 lncRNA and production of soluble versus membrane Fas in B-cell lymphoma.\r\nImpaired Fas-mediated apoptosis is associated with poor clinical outcomes and cancer chemoresistance. Soluble Fas receptor (sFas), produced by skipping of exon 6, inhibits apoptosis by sequestering Fas ligand. Serum sFas is associated with poor prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. We found that the alternative splicing of Fas in lymphomas is tightly regulated by a long-noncoding RNA corresponding to an antisense transcript of Fas (FAS-AS1). Levels of FAS-AS1 correlate inversely with production of sFas, and FAS-AS1 binding to the RBM5 inhibits RBM5-mediated exon 6 skipping. EZH2, often mutated or overexpressed in lymphomas, hyper-methylates the FAS-AS1 promoter and represses the FAS-AS1 expression. EZH2-mediated repression of FAS-AS1 promoter can be released by DZNeP (3-Deazaneplanocin A) or overcome by ectopic expression of FAS-AS1, both of which increase levels of FAS-AS1 and correspondingly decrease expression of sFas. Treatment with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor or EZH2 knockdown decreases the levels of EZH2, RBM5 and sFas, thereby enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis. This is the first report showing functional regulation of Fas repression by its antisense RNA. Our results reveal new therapeutic targets in lymphomas and provide a rationale for the use of EZH2 inhibitors or ibrutinib in combination with chemotherapeutic agents that recruit Fas for effective cell killing."

aS'Long non-coding RNA NR_045623 and NR_028291 involved in benzene hematotoxicity in occupationally benzene-exposed workers.\r\nBenzene is an established human hematotoxicant and leukemogen. New insights into the pathogenesis of benzene hematotoxicity are urgently needed. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) widely participate in various physiological and pathological processes. It has been shown that lncRNA plays an important role in hematologic malignancy tumorigenesis. However, the expression and biological function of lncRNA during benzene hematotoxicity progress remain largely unknown. An integrated analysis of differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA was performed to identify genes which were likely to be critical for benzene hematotoxicity through Microarray analysis. Dynamic gene network analysis of the differentially expressed lncRNA and mRNA was constructed and two main lncRNA (NR_045623 and NR_028291) were discovered and two key lncRNA subnets were involved in immune responses, hematopoiesis, B cell receptor signaling pathway and chronic myeloid leukemia. These findings suggested that NR_045623 and NR_028291 might be the key genes associated with benzene hematotoxicity.'

aS'A computational framework to infer human disease-associated long noncoding RNAs.\r\nAs a major class of noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in various critical biological processes. Accumulating researches have linked dysregulations and mutations of lncRNAs to a variety of human disorders and diseases. However, to date, only a few human lncRNAs have been associated with diseases. Therefore, it is very important to develop a computational method to globally predict potential associated diseases for human lncRNAs. In this paper, we developed a computational framework to accomplish this by combining human lncRNA expression profiles, gene expression profiles, and human disease-associated gene data. Applying this framework to available human long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) expression data, we showed that the framework has reliable accuracy. As a result, for non-tissue-specific lincRNAs, the AUC of our algorithm is 0.7645, and the prediction accuracy is about 89%. This study will be helpful for identifying novel lncRNAs for human diseases, which will help in understanding the roles of lncRNAs in human diseases and facilitate treatment. The corresponding codes for our method and the predicted results are all available at http://asdcd.amss.ac.cn/MingXiLiu/lncRNA-disease.html.'

aS"Human accelerated region 1 noncoding RNA is repressed by REST in Huntington's disease.\r\nIn the neurons of Huntington's disease (HD) patients, gene regulatory networks are disrupted by aberrant nuclear localization of the master transcriptional repressor REST. Emerging evidence suggests that, in addition to protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) may also contribute to neurodegenerative processes. To discover ncRNAs that are involved in HD, we screened genome-wide data for novel, noncoding targets of REST. This identified human accelerated region 1 (HAR1), a rapidly evolving cis-antisense locus that is specifically transcribed in the nervous system. We show that REST is targeted to the HAR1 locus by specific DNA regulatory motifs, resulting in potent transcriptional repression. Consistent with other REST target genes, HAR1 levels are significantly lower in the striatum of HD patients compared with unaffected individuals. These data represent further evidence that noncoding gene expression changes accompany neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease."

aS'Distinctive structures between chimpanzee and human in a brain noncoding RNA.\r\nHuman accelerated region 1 (HAR1) is a short DNA region identified recently to have evolved the most rapidly among highly constrained regions since the divergence from our common ancestor with chimpanzee. It is transcribed as part of a noncoding RNA specifically expressed in the developing human neocortex. Employing a panoply of enzymatic and chemical probes, our analysis of HAR1 RNA proposed a secondary structure model differing from that published. Most surprisingly, we discovered that the substitutions between the chimpanzee and human sequences led the human HAR1 RNA to adopt a cloverleaf-like structure instead of an extended and unstable hairpin in the chimpanzee sequence. Thus, the rapid evolutionary changes resulted in a profound rearrangement of HAR1 RNA structure. Altogether, our results provide a structural context for elucidating HAR1 RNA function.'

aS"A long noncoding RNA connects c-Myc to tumor metabolism.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. In prostate cancer, prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) is an androgen-induced prostate-specific lncRNA whose overexpression is highly associated with prostate tumors. PCGEM1's tumorigenic potential has been recently shown to be in part due to its ability to activate androgen receptor (AR). Here, we report a novel function of PCGEM1 that provides growth advantages for cancer cells by regulating tumor metabolism via c-Myc activation. PCGEM1 promotes glucose uptake for aerobic glycolysis, coupling with the pentose phosphate shunt to facilitate biosynthesis of nucleotide and lipid, and generates NADPH for redox homeostasis. We show that PCGEM1 regulates metabolism at a transcriptional level that affects multiple metabolic pathways, including glucose and glutamine metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The PCGEM1-mediated gene regulation takes place in part through AR activation, but predominantly through c-Myc activation, regardless of hormone or AR status. Significantly, PCGEM1 binds directly to target promoters, physically interacts with c-Myc, promotes chromatin recruitment of c-Myc, and enhances its transactivation activity. We also identified a c-Myc binding domain on PCGEM1 that contributes to the PCGEM1-dependent c-Myc activation and target induction. Together, our data uncover PCGEM1 as a key transcriptional regulator of central metabolic pathways in prostate cancer cells. By being a coactivator for both c-Myc and AR, PCGEM1 reprograms the androgen network and the central metabolism in a tumor-specific way, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention."

aS'Epigenetic upregulation of lncRNAs at 13q14.3 in leukemia is linked to the In Cis downregulation of a gene cluster that targets NF-kB.\r\nNon-coding RNAs are much more common than previously thought. However, for the vast majority of non-coding RNAs, the cellular function remains enigmatic. The two long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes DLEU1 and DLEU2 map to a critical region at chromosomal band 13q14.3 that is recurrently deleted in solid tumors and hematopoietic malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While no point mutations have been found in the protein coding candidate genes at 13q14.3, they are deregulated in malignant cells, suggesting an epigenetic tumor suppressor mechanism. We therefore characterized the epigenetic makeup of 13q14.3 in CLL cells and found histone modifications by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) that are associated with activated transcription and significant DNA-demethylation at the transcriptional start sites of DLEU1 and DLEU2 using 5 different semi-quantitative and quantitative methods (aPRIMES, BioCOBRA, MCIp, MassARRAY, and bisulfite sequencing). These epigenetic aberrations were correlated with transcriptional deregulation of the neighboring candidate tumor suppressor genes, suggesting a coregulation in cis of this gene cluster. We found that the 13q14.3 genes in addition to their previously known functions regulate NF-kB activity, which we could show after overexpression, siRNA-mediated knockdown, and dominant-negative mutant genes by using Western blots with previously undescribed antibodies, by a customized ELISA as well as by reporter assays. In addition, we performed an unbiased screen of 810 human miRNAs and identified the miR-15/16 family of genes at 13q14.3 as the strongest inducers of NF-kB activity. In summary, the tumor suppressor mechanism at 13q14.3 is a cluster of genes controlled by two lncRNA genes that are regulated by DNA-methylation and histone modifications and whose members all regulate NF-kB. Therefore, the tumor suppressor mechanism in 13q14.3 underlines the role both of epigenetic aberrations and of lncRNA genes in human tumorigenesis and is an example of colocalization of a functionally related gene cluster.'

aS'Whole transcriptome profiling reveals the RNA content of motor axons.\r\nMost RNAs within polarized cells such as neurons are sorted subcellularly in a coordinated manner. Despite advances in the development of methods for profiling polyadenylated RNAs from small amounts of input RNA, techniques for profiling coding and non-coding RNAs simultaneously are not well established. Here, we optimized a transcriptome profiling method based on double-random priming and applied it to serially diluted total RNA down to 10 pg. Read counts of expressed genes were robustly correlated between replicates, indicating that the method is both reproducible and scalable. Our transcriptome profiling method detected both coding and long non-coding RNAs sized &gt;300 bases. Compared to total RNAseq using a conventional approach our protocol detected 70% more genes due to reduced capture of ribosomal RNAs. We used our method to analyze the RNA composition of compartmentalized motoneurons. The somatodendritic compartment was enriched for transcripts with post-synaptic functions as well as for certain nuclear non-coding RNAs such as 7SK. In axons, transcripts related to translation were enriched including the cytoplasmic non-coding RNA 7SL. Our profiling method can be applied to a wide range of investigations including perturbations of subcellular transcriptomes in neurodegenerative diseases and investigations of microdissected tissue samples such as anatomically defined fiber tracts.'

aS'PVT1: a rising star among oncogenic long noncoding RNAs.\r\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that short and long noncoding RNAs critically participate in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and (mis)function. However, while the functional characterization of short non-coding RNAs has been reaching maturity, there is still a paucity of well characterized long noncoding RNAs, even though large studies in recent years are rapidly increasing the number of annotated ones. The long noncoding RNA PVT1 is encoded by a gene that has been long known since it resides in the well-known cancer risk region 8q24. However, a couple of accidental concurrent conditions have slowed down the study of this gene, that is, a preconception on the primacy of the protein-coding over noncoding RNAs and the prevalent interest in its neighbor MYC oncogene. Recent studies have brought PVT1 under the spotlight suggesting interesting models of functioning, such as competing endogenous RNA activity and regulation of protein stability of important oncogenes, primarily of the MYC oncogene. Despite some advancements in modelling the PVT1 role in cancer, there are many questions that remain unanswered concerning the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its functioning.'

aS"SINEUPs are modular antisense long non-coding RNAs that increase synthesis of target proteins in cells.\r\nDespite recent efforts in discovering novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and unveiling their functions in a wide range of biological processes their applications as biotechnological or therapeutic tools are still at their infancy. We have recently shown that AS Uchl1, a natural lncRNA antisense to the Parkinson's disease-associated gene Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal esterase L1 (Uchl1), is able to increase UchL1 protein synthesis at post-transcriptional level. Its activity requires two RNA elements: an embedded inverted SINEB2 sequence to increase translation and the overlapping region to target its sense mRNA. This functional organization is shared with several mouse lncRNAs antisense to protein coding genes. The potential use of AS Uchl1-derived lncRNAs as enhancers of target mRNA translation remains unexplored. Here we define AS Uchl1 as the representative member of a new functional class of natural and synthetic antisense lncRNAs that activate translation. We named this class of RNAs SINEUPs for their requirement of the inverted SINEB2 sequence to UP-regulate translation in a gene-specific manner. The overlapping region is indicated as the Binding Doman (BD) while the embedded inverted SINEB2 element is the Effector Domain (ED). By swapping BD, synthetic SINEUPs are designed targeting mRNAs of interest. SINEUPs function in an array of cell lines and can be efficiently directed toward N-terminally tagged proteins. Their biological activity is retained in a miniaturized version within the range of small RNAs length. Its modular structure was exploited to successfully design synthetic SINEUPs targeting endogenous Parkinson's disease-associated DJ-1 and proved to be active in different neuronal cell lines. In summary, SINEUPs represent the first scalable tool to increase synthesis of proteins of interest. We propose SINEUPs as reagents for molecular biology experiments, in protein manufacturing as well as in therapy of haploinsufficiencies."

aS'Expression and functions of long noncoding RNAs during human T helper cell differentiation.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate an array of biological processes in cells and organ systems. Less is known about their expression and function in lymphocyte lineages. Here we have identified &gt;2000 lncRNAs expressed in human T-cell cultures and those that display a TH lineage-specific pattern of expression and are intragenic or adjacent to TH lineage-specific genes encoding proteins with immunologic functions. One lncRNA cluster selectively expressed by the effector TH2 lineage consists of four alternatively spliced transcripts that regulate the expression of TH2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Genes encoding this lncRNA cluster in humans overlap the RAD50 gene and thus are contiguous with the previously described TH2 locus control region (LCR) in the mouse. Given its genomic synteny with the TH2-LCR, we refer to this lncRNA cluster as TH2-LCR lncRNA.'

aS'Characterization of the human cumulus cell transcriptome during final follicular maturation and ovulation.\r\nCumulus expansion and oocyte maturation are central processes in ovulation. Knowledge gained from rodent and other mammalian models has revealed some of the molecular pathways associated with these processes. However, the equivalent pathways in humans have not been thoroughly studied and remain unidentified. Compact cumulus cells (CCs) from germinal vesicle cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were obtained from patients undergoing in vitro maturation (IVM) procedures. Expanded CCs from metaphase 2 COC were obtained from patients undergoing IVF/ICSI. Global transcriptome profiles of the samples were obtained using state-of-the-art RNA sequencing techniques. We identified 1746 differentially expressed (DE) genes between compact and expanded CCs. Most of these genes were involved in cellular growth and proliferation, cellular movement, cell cycle, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, extracellular matrix and steroidogenesis. Out of the DE genes, we found 89 long noncoding RNAs, of which 12 are encoded within introns of genes known to be involved in granulosa cell processes. This suggests that unique noncoding RNA transcripts may contribute to the regulation of cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation. Using global transcriptome sequencing, we were able to generate a library of genes regulated during cumulus expansion and oocyte maturation processes. Analysis of these genes allowed us to identify important new genes and noncoding RNAs potentially involved in COC maturation and cumulus expansion. These results may increase our understanding of the process of oocyte maturation and could ultimately improve the efficacy of IVM treatment.'

aS'Balanced gene regulation by an embryonic brain ncRNA is critical for adult hippocampal GABA circuitry.\r\nGenomic studies demonstrate that, although the majority of the mammalian genome is transcribed, only about 2% of these transcripts are code for proteins. We investigated how the long, polyadenylated Evf2 noncoding RNA regulates transcription of the homeodomain transcription factors DLX5 and DLX6 in the developing mouse forebrain. We found that, in developing ventral forebrain, Evf2 recruited DLX and MECP2 transcription factors to important DNA regulatory elements in the Dlx5/6 intergenic region and controlled Dlx5, Dlx6 and Gad1 expression through trans and cis-acting mechanisms. Evf2 mouse mutants had reduced numbers of GABAergic interneurons in early postnatal hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Although the numbers of GABAergic interneurons and Gad1 RNA levels returned to normal in Evf2 mutant adult hippocampus, reduced synaptic inhibition occurred. These results suggest that noncoding RNA-dependent balanced gene regulation in embryonic brain is critical for proper formation of GABA-dependent neuronal circuitry in adult brain.'

aS'Non-Coding RNAs in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling and Cancer Metabolism.\r\nHormone-refractory prostate cancer frequently relapses from therapy and inevitably progresses to a bone-metastatic status with no cure. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to androgen deprivation therapy has the potential to lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets for type of prostate cancer with poor prognosis. Progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is characterized by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) expression and persistent AR signaling activity. Alterations in metabolic activity regulated by oncogenic pathways, such as c-Myc, were found to promote prostate cancer growth during the development of CRPC. Non-coding RNAs represent a diverse family of regulatory transcripts that drive tumorigenesis of prostate cancer and various other cancers by their hyperactivity or diminished function. A number of studies have examined differentially expressed non-coding RNAs in each stage of prostate cancer. Herein, we highlight the emerging impacts of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs linked to reactivation of the AR signaling axis and reprogramming of the cellular metabolism in prostate cancer. The translational implications of non-coding RNA research for developing new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for CRPC are also discussed.'

aS'Molecular mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes involved in a variety of biological functions. Here we discuss the emerging archetypes of molecular functions that lncRNAs execute-as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds. For each archetype, examples from several disparate biological contexts illustrate the commonality of the molecular mechanisms, and these mechanistic views provide useful explanations and predictions of biological outcomes. These archetypes of lncRNA function may be a useful framework to consider how lncRNAs acquire properties as biological signal transducers and hint at their possible origins in evolution. As new lncRNAs are being discovered at a rapid pace, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs are likely to be enriched and diversified.'

aS'The role of long non-coding RNAs in neurodevelopment, brain function and neurological disease.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts with low protein-coding potential that represent a large proportion of the transcriptional output of the cell. Many lncRNAs exhibit features indicative of functionality including tissue-restricted expression, localization to distinct subcellular structures, regulated expression and evolutionary conservation. Some lncRNAs have been shown to associate with chromatin-modifying activities and transcription factors, suggesting that a common mode of action may be to guide protein complexes to target genomic loci. However, the functions (if any) of the vast majority of lncRNA transcripts are currently unknown, and the subject of investigation. Here, we consider the putative role(s) of lncRNAs in neurodevelopment and brain function with an emphasis on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Associations of lncRNAs with neurodevelopmental/neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegeneration and brain cancers are also discussed.'

aS'Luminal long non-coding RNAs regulated by estrogen receptor alpha in a ligand-independent manner show functional roles in breast cancer.\r\nEstrogen Receptor alpha (ER\xce\xb1) activation by estrogenic hormones induces luminal breast cancer cell proliferation. However, ER\xce\xb1 plays also important hormone-independent functions to maintain breast tumor cells epithelial phenotype. We reported previously by RNA-Seq that in MCF-7 cells in absence of hormones ER\xce\xb1 down-regulation changes the expression of several genes linked to cellular development, representing a specific subset of estrogen-induced genes. Here, we report regulation of long non-coding RNAs from the same experimental settings. A list of 133 Apo-ER\xce\xb1-Regulated lncRNAs (AER-lncRNAs) was identified and extensively characterized using published data from cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, or experiments on MCF-7 cells. For several features, we ran validation using cell cultures or fresh tumor biopsies. AER-lncRNAs represent a specific subset, only marginally overlapping estrogen-induced transcripts, whose expression is largely restricted to luminal cells and which is able to perfectly classify breast tumor subtypes. The most abundant AER-lncRNA, DSCAM-AS1, is expressed in ER\xce\xb1+ breast carcinoma, but not in pre-neoplastic lesions, and correlates inversely with EMT markers. Down-regulation of DSCAM-AS1 recapitulated, in part, the effect of silencing ER\xce\xb1, i.e. growth arrest and induction of EMT markers. In conclusion, we report an ER\xce\xb1-dependent lncRNA set representing a novel luminal signature in breast cancer cells.'

aS'Right ventricular long noncoding RNA expression in human heart failure.\r\nThe expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human heart failure (HF) has not been widely studied. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we compared lncRNA expression in 22 explanted human HF hearts with lncRNA expression in 5 unused donor human hearts. We used Cufflinks to identify isoforms and DESeq to identify differentially expressed genes. We identified the noncoding RNAs by cross-reference to Ensembl release 73 (Genome Reference Consortium human genome build 37) and explored possible functional roles using a variety of online tools. In HF hearts, RNA-Seq identified 84,793 total messenger RNA coding and noncoding different transcripts, including 13,019 protein-coding genes, 2,085 total lncRNA genes, and 1,064 pseudogenes. By Ensembl noncoding RNA categories, there were 48 lncRNAs, 27 pseudogenes, and 30 antisense RNAs for a total of 105 differentially expressed lncRNAs in HF hearts. Compared with donor hearts, HF hearts exhibited differential expression of 7.7% of protein-coding genes, 3.7% of lncRNAs (including pseudogenes), and 2.5% of pseudogenes. There were not consistent correlations between antisense lncRNAs and parent genes and between pseudogenes and parent genes, implying differential regulation of expression. Exploratory in silico functional analyses using online tools suggested a variety of possible lncRNA regulatory roles. By providing a comprehensive profile of right ventricular polyadenylated messenger RNA transcriptome in HF, RNA-Seq provides an inventory of differentially expressed lncRNAs, including antisense transcripts and pseudogenes, for future mechanistic study.'

aS'Genome-wide transcript profiling reveals novel breast cancer-associated intronic sense RNAs.\r\nNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play major roles in development and cancer progression. To identify novel ncRNAs that may identify key pathways in breast cancer development, we performed high-throughput transcript profiling of tumor and normal matched-pair tissue samples. Initial transcriptome profiling using high-density genome-wide tiling arrays revealed changes in over 200 novel candidate genomic regions that map to intronic regions. Sixteen genomic loci were identified that map to the long introns of five key protein-coding genes, CRIM1, EPAS1, ZEB2, RBMS1, and RFX2. Consistent with the known role of the tumor suppressor ZEB2 in the cancer-associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), in situ hybridization reveals that the intronic regions deriving from ZEB2 as well as those from RFX2 and EPAS1 are down-regulated in cells of epithelial morphology, suggesting that these regions may be important for maintaining normal epithelial cell morphology. Paired-end deep sequencing analysis reveals a large number of distinct genomic clusters with no coding potential within the introns of these genes. These novel transcripts are only transcribed from the coding strand. A comprehensive search for breast cancer associated genes reveals enrichment for transcribed intronic regions from these loci, pointing to an underappreciated role of introns or mechanisms relating to their biology in EMT and breast cancer.'

aS"UM 9(5)h and UM 9(5)p, human and porcine noncoding transcripts with preferential expression in the cerebellum.\r\nWe compared the gene expression patterns of fetal and adult porcine brains and identified a sequence tag that was more abundant in adult than in fetal brain. The RNA corresponding to the sequence tag has the highest expression level in adult cerebellum. Lower expression levels of the transcript were found in adult cerebrum, pituitary, and uterus, as well as in fetal brain, heart, intestine, kidney, and liver. The sequence tag was used to screen a cDNA library from adult porcine brain. Two independent clones of 2,273 nt and 1,701 nt were isolated. The shorter cDNA is a 5'-truncated form of the longer clone, and both clones have almost identical sequences with multiple start and stop codons in all three reading frames. Screening of two different human brain cDNA libraries with porcine cDNA probes resulted in four overlapping cDNA fragments, which were assembled to one contig of 2,336 nt in length. Like noncoding RNAs, the porcine and human sequences have no common conserved open reading frame and share stretches of high homology interrupted by stretches with almost no homology. The human and porcine RNAs were named UM 9(5)h and UM 9(5)p, respectively. They are part of larger transcripts, which are transcribed from single-copy genes, they have very similar tissue distributions, and their sequences are colinear with the respective genomic fragment."

aS'Exploration of Deregulated Long Non-Coding RNAs in Association with Hepatocarcinogenesis and Survival.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are larger than 200 nucleotides in length and pervasively expressed across the genome. An increasing number of studies indicate that lncRNA transcripts play integral regulatory roles in cellular growth, division, differentiation and apoptosis. Deregulated lncRNAs have been observed in a variety of human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We determined the expression profiles of 90 lncRNAs for 65 paired HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues, and 55 lncRNAs were expressed in over 90% of samples. Eight lncRNAs were significantly down-regulated in HCC tumor compared to non-tumor tissues (p &lt; 0.05), but no lncRNA achieved statistical significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Within tumor tissues, carrying more aberrant lncRNAs (6-7) was associated with a borderline significant reduction Cancers 2015, 7 1848 in survival (HR = 8.5, 95% CI: 1.0-72.5). The predictive accuracy depicted by the AUC was 0.93 for HCC survival when using seven deregulated lncRNAs (likelihood ratio test p = 0.001), which was similar to that combining the seven lncRNAs with tumor size and treatment (AUC = 0.96, sensitivity = 87%, specificity = 87%). These data suggest the potential association of deregulated lncRNAs with hepatocarcinogenesis and HCC survival.'

aS'The structure, function and evolution of proteins that bind DNA and RNA.\r\nProteins that bind both DNA and RNA typify the ability of a single gene product to perform multiple functions. Such DNA- and RNA-binding proteins (DRBPs) have unique functional characteristics that stem from their specific structural features; these developed early in evolution and are widely conserved. Proteins that bind RNA have typically been considered as functionally distinct from proteins that bind DNA and studied independently. This practice is becoming outdated, in partly owing to the discovery of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that target DNA-binding proteins. Consequently, DRBPs were found to regulate many cellular processes, including transcription, translation, gene silencing, microRNA biogenesis and telomere maintenance.'

aS"The IC-SNURF-SNRPN transcript serves as a host for multiple small nucleolar RNA species and as an antisense RNA for UBE3A.\r\nThe imprinted domain on human chromosome 15 consists of two oppositely imprinted gene clusters, which are under the coordinated control of an imprinting center (IC) at the 5' end of the SNURF-SNRPN gene. One gene cluster spans the centromeric part of this domain and contains several genes that are transcribed from the paternal chromosome only (MKRN3, MAGEL2, NDN, SNURF-SNRPN, HBII-13, HBII-85 and HBII-52). Apart from the HBII small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes, each of these genes is associated with a 5' differentially methylated region (DMR). The second gene cluster maps to the telomeric part of the imprinted domain and contains two genes (UBE3A and ATP10C), which in some tissues are preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome. So far, no DMR has been identified at these loci. Instead, maternal-only expression of UBE3A may be regulated indirectly through a paternally expressed antisense transcript. We report here that a processed antisense transcript of UBE3A starts at the IC. The SNURF-SNRPN sense/UBE3A antisense transcription unit spans more than 460 kb and contains at least 148 exons, including the previously identified IPW exons. It serves as the host for the previously identified HBII-13, HBII-85 and HBII-52 snoRNAs as well as for four additional snoRNAs (HBII-436, HBII-437, HBII-438A and HBII-438B), newly identified in this study. Almost all of those snoRNAs are encoded within introns of this large transcript. Northern blot analysis indicates that most if not all of these snoRNAs are indeed expressed by processing from these introns. As we have not obtained any evidence for other genes in this region, which, from the mouse data appears to be critical for the neonatal Prader-Willi syndrome phenotype, a lack of these snoRNAs may be causally involved in this disease."

aS'Expression analysis in intestinal mucosa reveals complex relations among genes under the association peaks in celiac disease.\r\nCeliac disease is a chronic immune-mediated disorder with an important genetic component. To date, there are 57 independent association signals from 39 non-HLA loci, and a total of 66 candidate genes have been proposed. We aimed to scrutinize the functional implication of 45 of those genes by analyzing their expression in the disease tissue of celiac patients (at diagnosis/treatment) compared with non-celiac controls. Moreover, we investigated the SNP genotype effect in gene expression and performed coexpression analyses. Several genes showed differential expression among disease groups, most of them related to immune response. Multiple trans-eQTLs but only four cis-eQTLs were found, and surprisingly the genotype effect seems to be stimulus dependent as it differs among groups. Coexpression levels vary from higher to lower levels in active patients at diagnosis, treated patients and non-celiac controls respectively. A subset of 18 genes tightly correlated in both groups of patients but not in controls was identified. Interestingly, this subset of genes was influenced by the genotype of three SNPs. One of the SNPs, rs1018326 on chromosome two is on top of a known lincRNA whose function is not yet described, and whose expression seems to be upregulated in active disease when comparing biopsy pairs from the same individuals. Our results strongly suggest that the effects of disease-associated SNPs go far beyond the oversimplistic idea of transcriptional control at a nearby locus. Further investigations are needed to determine how each variant disrupts fine-tuning mechanisms in the genome that eventually lead to disease.'

aS'Imprinted chromatin around DIRAS3 regulates alternative splicing of GNG12-AS1, a long noncoding RNA.\r\nImprinted gene clusters are regulated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), CCCTC binding factor (CTCF)-mediated boundaries, and DNA methylation. DIRAS3 (also known as ARH1 or NOEY1) is an imprinted gene encoding a protein belonging to the RAS superfamily of GTPases and is located within an intron of a lncRNA called GNG12-AS1. In this study, we investigated whether GNG12-AS1 is imprinted and coregulated with DIRAS3. We report that GNG12-AS1 is coexpressed with DIRAS3 in several tissues and coordinately downregulated with DIRAS3 in breast cancers. GNG12-AS1 has several splice variants, all of which initiate from a single transcription start site. In placenta tissue and normal cell lines, GNG12-AS1 is biallelically expressed but some isoforms are allele-specifically spliced. Cohesin plays a role in allele-specific splicing of GNG12-AS1. In breast cancer cell lines with loss of DIRAS3 imprinting, DIRAS3 and GNG12-AS1 are silenced in cis and the remaining GNG12-AS1 transcripts are predominantly monoallelic. The GNG12-AS1 locus, which includes DIRAS3, provides an example of imprinted cotranscriptional splicing and a potential model system for studying the long-range effects of CTCF-cohesin binding on splicing and transcriptional interference.'

aS'[Comparative organization and the origin of noncoding regulatory RNA genes from X-chromosome inactivation center of human and mouse].\r\nAfter the radiation of primates and rodents, the evolution of X-chromosome inactivation centers in human and mouse (XIC/Xic) followed two different directions. Human XIC followed the pathway towards transposon accumulation (the repeat proportion in the center constitutes 72%), especially LINEs, which prevail in the center. On the contrary, mouse Xic eliminated long repeats and accumulated species-specific SIN Es (the repeat proportion in the center constitutes 35%). The mechanism underlying inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in female mammals appeared on the basis of trasnsposons. The key gene of the inactivation process, XIST/Xist, similarly to other long noncoding RNA genes, like TSIX/Tsix, JPX/Jpx, and FTX/Ftx, was formed with the involvement of different transposon sequences. Furthermore, two clusters ofmicroRNA genes from inactivation center originated from L2 [1]. In mouse, one of such clusters has been preserved in the form of microRNA pseudogenes. Thus, long ncRNA genes and microRNAs appeared during the period of transposable elements expansion in this locus, 140 to 105 Myr ago, after the radiation of marsupials and placental mammal lineages.'

aS'Digital genome-wide ncRNA expression, including SnoRNAs, across 11 human tissues using polyA-neutral amplification.\r\nNon-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are an essential class of molecular species that have been difficult to monitor on high throughput platforms due to frequent lack of polyadenylation. Using a polyadenylation-neutral amplification protocol and next-generation sequencing, we explore ncRNA expression in eleven human tissues. ncRNAs 7SL, U2, 7SK, and HBII-52 are expressed at levels far exceeding mRNAs. C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs are associated with rRNA methylation and pseudouridylation, respectively: spleen expresses both, hypothalamus expresses mainly C/D box snoRNAs, and testes show enriched expression of both H/ACA box snoRNAs and RNA telomerase TERC. Within the snoRNA 14q cluster, 14q(I-6) is expressed at much higher levels than other cluster members. More reads align to mitochondrial than nuclear tRNAs. Many lincRNAs are actively transcribed, particularly those overlapping known ncRNAs. Within the Prader-Willi syndrome loci, the snoRNA HBII-85 (group I) cluster is highly expressed in hypothalamus, greater than in other tissues and greater than group II or III. Additionally, within the disease locus we find novel transcription across a 400,000 nt span in ovaries. This genome-wide polyA-neutral expression compendium demonstrates the richness of ncRNA expression, their high expression patterns, their function-specific expression patterns, and is publicly available.'

aS'Long noncoding RNAs: Lessons from genomic imprinting.\r\nGenomic imprinting has been a great resource for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional-based gene regulation by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this article, I overview the functional role of intergenic lncRNAs (H19, IPW, and MEG3), antisense lncRNAs (Kcnq1ot1, Airn, Nespas, Ube3a-ATS), and enhancer lncRNAs (IG-DMR eRNAs) to understand the diverse mechanisms being employed by them in cis and/or trans to regulate the parent-of-origin-specific expression of target genes. Recent evidence suggests that some of the lncRNAs regulate imprinting by promoting intra-chromosomal higher-order chromatin compartmentalization, affecting replication timing and subnuclear positioning. Whereas others act via transcriptional occlusion or transcriptional collision-based mechanisms. By establishing genomic imprinting of target genes, the lncRNAs play a critical role in important biological functions, such as placental and embryonic growth, pluripotency maintenance, cell differentiation, and neural-related functions such as synaptic development and plasticity. An emerging consensus from the recent evidence is that the imprinted lncRNAs fine-tune gene expression of the protein-coding genes to maintain their dosage in cell. Hence, lncRNAs from imprinted clusters offer insights into their mode of action, and these mechanisms have been the basis for uncovering the mode of action of lncRNAs in several other biological contexts. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Clues to long noncoding RNA taxonomy, edited by Dr. Tetsuro Hirose and Dr. Shinichi Nakagawa.'

aS'Expression analysis of four long noncoding RNAs in breast cancer.\r\nBreast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease which necessitates a search for markers to provide a more specific classification of this disorder. Long noncoding RNAs as the important subset of noncoding transcripts have been shown to be involved in tumorigenic processes. So, they may be used as markers for early detection of cancer and evaluation of cancer prognosis. In addition, they can be applied as therapeutic targets. In this study, we analyzed expression of four long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) namely SOX2OT, PTPRG-AS1, ANRASSF1, and ANRIL in 38 breast cancer tissues and their adjacent noncancerous tissues (ANCTs). ANRASSF1 expression was not detected in any noncancerous tissue. All lncRNAs showed significant overexpression in tumor tissues compared with ANCTs. No association was found between gene expressions and individual clinical data such as tumor stage, grade, size and hormone receptor status except for ANRASSF1 expression and Her2/neu status. In addition, ANRASSF1 and ANRIL expressions were significantly higher in triple negative samples. This study suggests a putative role for these lncRNAs in breast cancer and implies that they can be used as potential cancer biomarkers.'

aS"Identification of differential methylation of the WT1 antisense regulatory region and relaxation of imprinting in Wilms' tumor.\r\nWilms' tumor (WT) is associated with loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 11p13, the site of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1. Although the preferential loss of maternal alleles suggested that differential allelic expression of WT1 might occur, this has not been evident in normal fetal tissues or WTs. In this study, we show that the WT1 antisense regulatory region is differentially methylated, with Southern blot analysis of four loss of heterozygosity-negative WTs and their corresponding normal kidneys indicating that allelic methylation is lost in WTs. Reverse transcription-PCR expression analysis correlates methylation with monoallelic expression of the antisense WT1 transcript (WT1-AS) in normal kidney. However, WTs display hypomethylation and biallelic expression of WT1-AS. Our findings are consistent with imprinting of WT1-AS in normal kidney and the relaxation of imprinting in Wilms' tumorigenesis. This identifies the WT1 antisense regulatory region in intron 1 as a primary site for epigenetic deregulation at chromosome 11p13 in WTs."

aS"Principles of long noncoding RNA evolution derived from direct comparison of transcriptomes in 17 species.\r\nThe inability to predict long noncoding RNAs from genomic sequence has impeded the use of comparative genomics for studying their biology. Here, we develop methods that use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to annotate the transcriptomes of 16 vertebrates and the echinoid sea urchin, uncovering thousands of previously unannotated genes, most of which produce long intervening noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs). Although in each species, &gt;70% of lincRNAs cannot be traced to homologs in species that diverged &gt;50 million years ago, thousands of human lincRNAs have homologs with similar expression patterns in other species. These homologs share short, 5'-biased patches of sequence conservation nested in exonic architectures that have been extensively rewired, in part by transposable element exonization. Thus, over a thousand human lincRNAs are likely to have conserved functions in mammals, and hundreds beyond mammals, but those functions require only short patches of specific sequences and can tolerate major changes in gene architecture."

aS"p53-Regulated Networks of Protein, mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA Expression Revealed by Integrated Pulsed Stable Isotope Labeling With Amino Acids in Cell Culture (pSILAC) and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analyses.\r\nWe determined the effect of p53 activation on de novo protein synthesis using quantitative proteomics (pulsed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture/pSILAC) in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. This was combined with mRNA and noncoding RNA expression analyses by next generation sequencing (RNA-, miR-Seq). Furthermore, genome-wide DNA binding of p53 was analyzed by chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq). Thereby, we identified differentially regulated proteins (542 up, 569 down), mRNAs (1258 up, 415 down), miRNAs (111 up, 95 down) and lncRNAs (270 up, 123 down). Changes in protein and mRNA expression levels showed a positive correlation (r = 0.50, p &lt; 0.0001). In total, we detected 133 direct p53 target genes that were differentially expressed and displayed p53 occupancy in the vicinity of their promoter. More transcriptionally induced genes displayed occupied p53 binding sites (4.3% mRNAs, 7.2% miRNAs, 6.3% lncRNAs, 5.9% proteins) than repressed genes (2.4% mRNAs, 3.2% miRNAs, 0.8% lncRNAs, 1.9% proteins), suggesting indirect mechanisms of repression. Around 50% of the down-regulated proteins displayed seed-matching sequences of p53-induced miRNAs in the corresponding 3'-UTRs. Moreover, proteins repressed by p53 significantly overlapped with those previously shown to be repressed by miR-34a. We confirmed up-regulation of the novel direct p53 target genes LINC01021, MDFI, ST14 and miR-486 and showed that ectopic LINC01021 expression inhibits proliferation in SW480 cells. Furthermore, KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT mRNAs were confirmed as direct targets of the p53-induced miR-34a, miR-205 and miR-486-5p, respectively. In line with the loss of p53 function during tumor progression, elevated expression of KLF12, HMGB1 and CIT was detected in advanced stages of cancer. In conclusion, the integration of multiple omics methods allowed the comprehensive identification of direct and indirect effectors of p53 that provide new insights and leads into the mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression."

aS'Origin and evolution of the long non-coding genes in the X-inactivation center.\r\nRandom X chromosome inactivation (XCI), the eutherian mechanism of X-linked gene dosage compensation, is controlled by a cis-acting locus termed the X-inactivation center (Xic). One of the striking features that characterize the Xic landscape is the abundance of loci transcribing non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including Xist, the master regulator of the inactivation process. Recent comparative genomic analyses have depicted the evolutionary scenario behind the origin of the X-inactivation center, revealing that this locus evolved from a region harboring protein-coding genes. During mammalian radiation, this ancestral protein-coding region was disrupted in the marsupial group, whilst it provided in eutherian lineage the starting material for the non-translated RNAs of the X-inactivation center. The emergence of non-coding genes occurred by a dual mechanism involving loss of protein-coding function of the pre-existing genes and integration of different classes of mobile elements, some of which modeled the structure and sequence of the non-coding genes in a species-specific manner. The rising genes started to produce transcripts that acquired function in regulating the epigenetic status of the X chromosome, as shown for Xist, its antisense Tsix, Jpx, and recently suggested for Ftx. Thus, the appearance of the Xic, which occurred after the divergence between eutherians and marsupials, was the basis for the evolution of random X inactivation as a strategy to achieve dosage compensation.'

aS'RNA-Seq of human neurons derived from iPS cells reveals candidate long non-coding RNAs involved in neurogenesis and neuropsychiatric disorders.\r\nGenome-wide expression analysis using next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides an opportunity for in-depth molecular profiling of fundamental biological processes, such as cellular differentiation and malignant transformation. Differentiating human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an ideal system for RNA-Seq since defective neurogenesis caused by abnormalities in transcription factors, DNA methylation, and chromatin modifiers lie at the heart of some neuropsychiatric disorders. As a preliminary step towards applying next generation sequencing using neurons derived from patient-specific iPSCs, we have carried out an RNA-Seq analysis on control human neurons. Dramatic changes in the expression of coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), pseudogenes, and splice isoforms were seen during the transition from pluripotent stem cells to early differentiating neurons. A number of genes that undergo radical changes in expression during this transition include candidates for schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that function as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers, such as POU3F2 and ZNF804A, and genes coding for cell adhesion proteins implicated in these conditions including NRXN1 and NLGN1. In addition, a number of novel lncRNAs were found to undergo dramatic changes in expression, one of which is HOTAIRM1, a regulator of several HOXA genes during myelopoiesis. The increase we observed in differentiating neurons suggests a role in neurogenesis as well. Finally, several lncRNAs that map near SNPs associated with SZ in genome wide association studies also increase during neuronal differentiation, suggesting that these novel transcripts may be abnormally regulated in a subgroup of patients.'

aS'Computational evidence of NAGNAG alternative splicing in human large intergenic noncoding RNA.\r\nNAGNAG alternative splicing plays an essential role in biological processes and represents a highly adaptable system for posttranslational regulation of gene function. NAGNAG alternative splicing impacts a myriad of biological processes. Previous studies of NAGNAG largely focused on messenger RNA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study testing the hypothesis that NAGNAG alternative splicing is also operative in large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA). The RNA-seq data sets from recent deep sequencing studies were queried to test our hypothesis. NAGNAG alternative splicing of human lincRNA was identified while querying two independent RNA-seq data sets. Within these datasets, 31 NAGNAG alternative splicing sites were identified in lincRNA. Notably, most exons of lincRNA containing NAGNAG acceptors were longer than those from protein-coding genes. Furthermore, presence of CAG coding appeared to participate in the splice site selection. Finally, expression of the isoforms of NAGNAG lincRNA exhibited tissue specificity. Together, this study improves our understanding of the NAGNAG alternative splicing in lincRNA.'

aS'Construction of a lncRNA-PCG bipartite network and identification of cancer-related lncRNAs: a case study in prostate cancer.\r\nLncRNAs are involved in a wide range of biological processes, such as chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, mRNA editing and translation. They can either upregulate or downregulate gene expression, and play key roles in the progression of various human cancers. However, the functional mechanisms of most lncRNAs still remain unknown at present. This paper aims to provide space for the understanding of lncRNAs by proposing a new method to obtain protein-coding genes (PCGs) regulated by lncRNAs, thus identifying candidate cancer-related lncRNAs using bioinformatics approaches. This study presents a method based on sample correlation, which is applied to the expression profiles of lncRNAs and PCGs in prostate cancer in combination with protein interaction data to build a lncRNA-PCG bipartite network. Candidate cancer-related lncRNAs were extracted from the bipartite network by using a random walk. 14 prostate cancer-related lncRNAs were acquired from the LncRNADisease database and MNDR, of which 6 lncRNAs were present in our network. As one of the seed nodes, ENSG00000234741 achieved the highest score among them. The other two cancer-related lncRNAs (ENSG00000225937 and ENSG00000236830) were ranked within the top 30. In addition, the top candidate lncRNA ENSG00000261777 shares an intron with DDX19, and interacts with IGF2 P1, indicating its involvement in prostate cancer. In this paper, we described a new method for predicting candidate lncRNA targets, and obtained candidate therapeutic targets using this method. We hope that this study will bring a new perspective in future lncRNA studies.'

aS'Differential lncRNA\xe2\x80\x91mRNA co\xe2\x80\x91expression network analysis revealing the potential regulatory roles of lncRNAs in myocardial infarction.\r\nPrevious studies have reported that long, non\xe2\x80\x91coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important in cardiovascular disease. However, the lncRNAs involved in myocardial infarction and their detailed mechanism have not been well characterized. In the present study, an affymetrix microarray associated with myocardial infarction was re\xe2\x80\x91annotated, following which a myocardial infarction\xe2\x80\x91related differential lncRNA\xe2\x80\x91mRNA co\xe2\x80\x91expression network (MILMN) was constructed. Subsequently, pathway enrichment analysis was used for all the mRNAs in the MILMN, and an lncRNA\xe2\x80\x91pathway network was constructed. It was found that the mRNAs were predominantly involved in certain cardiovascular disease\xe2\x80\x91associated pathway, for example the dilated cardiomyopathy and mitogen\xe2\x80\x91activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Finally, a total of 39 key lncRNAs were identified, which regulate crucial pathways in myocardial infarction. Through pathway analysis of these 39 key lncRNAs, the novel function of an annotated lncRNAs\xe2\x80\x91H19 was predicted, which may regulate apoptosis signal\xe2\x80\x91regulating kinase, which is a protein that promotes pathological cardiac remodeling following myocardial infarction. The results of the present study not only provide potential non\xe2\x80\x91coding RNA biomarkers, but also provide further insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of lncRNAs.'

aS'A novel reannotation strategy for dissecting DNA methylation patterns of human long intergenic non-coding RNAs in cancers.\r\nDespite growing consensus that long intergenic non-coding ribonucleic acids (lincRNAs) are modulators of cancer, the knowledge about the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns of lincRNAs in cancers remains limited. In this study, we constructed DNA methylation profiles for 4629 tumors and 705 normal tissue samples from 20 different types of human cancer by reannotating data of DNA methylation arrays. We found that lincRNAs had different promoter methylation patterns in cancers. We classified 2461 lincRNAs into two categories and three subcategories, according to their promoter methylation patterns in tumors. LincRNAs with resistant methylation patterns in tumors had conserved transcriptional regulation regions and were ubiquitously expressed across normal tissues. By integrating cancer subtype data and patient clinical information, we identified lincRNAs with promoter methylation patterns that were associated with cancer status, subtype or prognosis for several cancers. Network analysis of aberrantly methylated lincRNAs in cancers showed that lincRNAs with aberrant methylation patterns might be involved in cancer development and progression. The methylated and demethylated lincRNAs identified in this study provide novel insights for developing cancer biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.'

aS'The Novel Gene CRNDE Encodes a Nuclear Peptide (CRNDEP) Which Is Overexpressed in Highly Proliferating Tissues.\r\nCRNDE, recently described as the lncRNA-coding gene, is overexpressed at RNA level in human malignancies. Its role in gametogenesis, cellular differentiation and pluripotency has been suggested as well. Herein, we aimed to verify our hypothesis that the CRNDE gene may encode a protein product, CRNDEP. By using bioinformatics methods, we identified the 84-amino acid ORF encoded by one of two CRNDE transcripts, previously described by our research team. This ORF was cloned into two expression vectors, subsequently utilized in localization studies in HeLa cells. We also developed a polyclonal antibody against CRNDEP. Its specificity was confirmed in immunohistochemical, cellular localization, Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments, as well as by showing a statistically significant decrease of endogenous CRNDEP expression in the cells with transient shRNA-mediated knockdown of CRNDE. Endogenous CRNDEP localizes predominantly to the nucleus and its expression seems to be elevated in highly proliferating tissues, like the parabasal layer of the squamous epithelium, intestinal crypts or spermatocytes. After its artificial overexpression in HeLa cells, in a fusion with either the EGFP or DsRed Monomer fluorescent tag, CRNDEP seems to stimulate the formation of stress granules and localize to them. Although the exact role of CRNDEP is unknown, our preliminary results suggest that it may be involved in the regulation of the cell proliferation. Possibly, CRNDEP also participates in oxygen metabolism, considering our in silico results, and the correlation between its enforced overexpression and the formation of stress granules. This is the first report showing the existence of a peptide encoded by the CRNDE gene.'

aS'Long noncoding RNAs are rarely translated in two human cell lines.\r\nData from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project show over 9640 human genome loci classified as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), yet only ~100 have been deeply characterized to determine their role in the cell. To measure the protein-coding output from these RNAs, we jointly analyzed two recent data sets produced in the ENCODE project: tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data mapping expressed peptides to their encoding genomic loci, and RNA-seq data generated by ENCODE in long polyA+ and polyA- fractions in the cell lines K562 and GM12878. We used the machine-learning algorithm RuleFit3 to regress the peptide data against RNA expression data. The most important covariate for predicting translation was, surprisingly, the Cytosol polyA- fraction in both cell lines. LncRNAs are ~13-fold less likely to produce detectable peptides than similar mRNAs, indicating that ~92% of GENCODE v7 lncRNAs are not translated in these two ENCODE cell lines. Intersecting 9640 lncRNA loci with 79,333 peptides yielded 85 unique peptides matching 69 lncRNAs. Most cases were due to a coding transcript misannotated as lncRNA. Two exceptions were an unprocessed pseudogene and a bona fide lncRNA gene, both with open reading frames (ORFs) compromised by upstream stop codons. All potentially translatable lncRNA ORFs had only a single peptide match, indicating low protein abundance and/or false-positive peptide matches. We conclude that with very few exceptions, ribosomes are able to distinguish coding from noncoding transcripts and, hence, that ectopic translation and cryptic mRNAs are rare in the human lncRNAome.'

aS"Evidence for a crucial role of a host non-coding RNA in influenza A virus replication.\r\nA growing body of evidence suggests the non-protein coding human genome is of vital importance for human cell function. Besides small RNAs, the diverse class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently came into focus. However, their relevance for infection, a major evolutionary driving force, remains elusive. Using two commercially available microarray systems, namely NCode\xe2\x84\xa2 and Sureprint\xe2\x84\xa2 G3, we identified differential expression of 42 ncRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in human lung epithelial cells. This included several classes of lncRNAs, including large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs). As analyzed by qRT-PCR, expression of one lincRNA, which we termed virus inducible lincRNA (VIN), is induced by several IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, H7N7) as well as vesicular stomatitis virus. However, we did not observe an induction of VIN by influenza B virus, treatment with RNA mimics, or IFN\xce\xb2. Thus, VIN expression seems to be a specific response to certain viral infections. RNA fractionation and RNA-FISH experiments revealed that VIN is localized to the host cell nucleus. Most importantly, we show that abolition of VIN by RNA interference restricts IAV replication and viral protein synthesis, highlighting the relevance of this lincRNA for productive IAV infection. Our observations suggest that viral pathogens interfere with the non-coding portion of the human genome, thereby guaranteeing their successful propagation, and that the expression of VIN correlates with their virulence. Consequently, our study provides a novel approach for understanding virus pathogenesis in greater detail, which will enable future design of new antiviral strategies targeting the host's non-protein coding genome."

aS'Identification of lncRNA-associated competing triplets reveals global patterns and prognostic markers for cancer.\r\nRecent studies have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and indirectly regulate miRNA targets though competing interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are still largely unknown. In this study, these lncRNA-miRNA-gene interactions were defined as lncRNA-associated competing triplets (LncACTs), and an integrated pipeline was developed to identify lncACTs that are active in cancer. Competing lncRNAs had sponge features distinct from non-competing lncRNAs. In the lncACT cross-talk network, disease-associated lncRNAs, miRNAs and coding-genes showed specific topological patterns indicative of their competence and control of communication within the network. The construction of global competing activity profiles revealed that lncACTs had high activity specific to cancers. Analyses of clustered lncACTs revealed that they were enriched in various cancer-related biological processes. Based on the global cross-talk network and cluster analyses, nine cancer-specific sub-networks were constructed. H19- and BRCA1/2-associated lncACTs were able to discriminate between two groups of patients with different clinical outcomes. Disease-associated lncACTs also showed variable competing patterns across normal and cancer patient samples. In summary, this study uncovered and systematically characterized global properties of human lncACTs that may have prognostic value for predicting clinical outcome in cancer patients.'

aS"HuD regulates coding and noncoding RNA to induce APP\xe2\x86\x92A\xce\xb2 processing.\r\nThe primarily neuronal RNA-binding protein HuD is implicated in learning and memory. Here, we report the identification of several HuD target transcripts linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. HuD interacted with the 3' UTRs of APP mRNA (encoding amyloid precursor protein) and BACE1 mRNA (encoding \xce\xb2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) and increased the half-lives of these mRNAs. HuD also associated with and stabilized the long noncoding (lnc)RNA BACE1AS, which partly complements BACE1 mRNA and enhances BACE1 expression. Consistent with HuD promoting production of APP and APP-cleaving enzyme, the levels of APP, BACE1, BACE1AS, and A\xce\xb2 were higher in the brain of HuD-overexpressing mice. Importantly, cortex (superior temporal gyrus) from patients with AD displayed significantly higher levels of HuD and, accordingly, elevated APP, BACE1, BACE1AS, and A\xce\xb2 than did cortical tissue from healthy age-matched individuals. We propose that HuD jointly promotes the production of APP and the cleavage of its amyloidogenic fragment, A\xce\xb2."

aS'Deciphering the 8q24.21 association for glioma.\r\nWe have previously identified tagSNPs at 8q24.21 influencing glioma risk. We have sought to fine-map the location of the functional basis of this association using data from four genome-wide association studies, comprising a total of 4147 glioma cases and 7435 controls. To improve marker density across the 700 kb region, we imputed genotypes using 1000 Genomes Project data and high-coverage sequencing data generated on 253 individuals. Analysis revealed an imputed low-frequency SNP rs55705857 (P = 2.24 \xc3\x97 10(-38)) which was sufficient to fully capture the 8q24.21 association. Analysis by glioma subtype showed the association with rs55705857 confined to non-glioblastoma multiforme (non-GBM) tumours (P = 1.07 \xc3\x97 10(-67)). Validation of the non-GBM association was shown in three additional datasets (625 non-GBM cases, 2412 controls; P = 1.41 \xc3\x97 10(-28)). In the pooled analysis, the odds ratio for low-grade glioma associated with rs55705857 was 4.3 (P = 2.31 \xc3\x97 10(-94)). rs55705857 maps to a highly evolutionarily conserved sequence within the long non-coding RNA CCDC26 raising the possibility of direct functionality. These data provide additional insights into the aetiological basis of glioma development.'

aS"Computational analysis of functional long noncoding RNAs reveals lack of peptide-coding capacity and parallels with 3' UTRs.\r\nRecent transcriptome analyses have indicated that a large part of mammalian genomes are transcribed into long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, only a very small fraction of them have been individually studied, and whether the majority of lncRNAs found in large-scale studies have a cellular role is debated. To gain insight into the sequence features and genomic architecture of the subset of lncRNAs that have been proven to be functional, we created a database containing studied lncRNAs manually culled from the literature along with a parallel database containing all annotated protein-coding human RNAs. The Functional lncRNA Database, which contains 204 lncRNAs and their splicing variants, is available at valadkhanlab.org/database. Analysis of the lncRNAs and their comparison to protein-coding transcripts revealed sequence features including paucity of introns and low GC content in lncRNAs, which could explain several biological characteristics of these transcripts, such as their nuclear localization and low expression level. The predicted ORFs in lncRNAs have poor start codon and ORF contexts, which would lead to activation of the nonsense-mediated decay pathways and thus make it unlikely for most lncRNAs to code for even short peptides. Interestingly, our analyses revealed significant similarities between the lncRNAs and the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) in protein-coding RNAs in structural features and sequence composition. The presence of these intriguing parallels between the lncRNAs and 3' UTRs, which constitute the two main components of the RNA-mediated cellular regulatory system, indicates that highly similar evolutionary constraints govern the function of regulatory RNA sequences in the cell."

aS'Gene expression from the imprinted Dio3 locus is associated with cell proliferation of cultured brown adipocytes.\r\nActive thyroid hormones are critical for the differentiation and function of brown adipose tissue. However, we have observed high basal and induced levels of type 3 deiodinase (D3), an enzyme that inactivates thyroid hormones and is coded by the imprinted gene Dio3, in differentiating brown preadipocytes in primary culture. We find that D3 activity and mRNA expression strongly correlate with the rate of proliferation of undifferentiated precursor cells under various conditions. Furthermore, differentiation of precursor cells to adipocytes is associated with decreased levels of D3 expression, and only very low levels of D3 mRNA are found in mature adipocytes. Dlk1, an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation and a paternally expressed gene located in the same imprinted domain as Dio3, displayed changes in expression that parallel those of Dio3. In contrast, a 4-kb transcript for Dio3os, an antisense gene also located in the same imprinted domain, is markedly up-regulated in differentiated adipocytes. We conclude that D3 expression in differentiating preadipocytes is primarily linked to proliferating cells, whereas Dio3os expression is associated with mature adipocytes. Our results suggest that genomic imprinting and gene expression at the Dlk1/Dio3 imprinted domain may play a role in the regulation of adipocyte proliferation and differentiation.'

aS"Ab initio reconstruction of cell type-specific transcriptomes in mouse reveals the conserved multi-exonic structure of lincRNAs.\r\nMassively parallel cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides an unbiased way to study a transcriptome, including both coding and noncoding genes. Until now, most RNA-Seq studies have depended crucially on existing annotations and thus focused on expression levels and variation in known transcripts. Here, we present Scripture, a method to reconstruct the transcriptome of a mammalian cell using only RNA-Seq reads and the genome sequence. We applied it to mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal precursor cells and lung fibroblasts to accurately reconstruct the full-length gene structures for most known expressed genes. We identified substantial variation in protein coding genes, including thousands of novel 5' start sites, 3' ends and internal coding exons. We then determined the gene structures of more than a thousand large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) and antisense loci. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of thousands of noncoding RNAs and demonstrate the power of ab initio reconstruction to render a comprehensive picture of mammalian transcriptomes."

aS'Long non-coding RNAs and control of gene expression in the immune system.\r\nAll cells of the immune system rely on a highly integrated and dynamic gene expression program that is controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Recently, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological contexts. lncRNAs control gene expression in the nucleus by modulating transcription or via post-transcriptional mechanisms targeting the splicing, stability, or translation of mRNAs. Our knowledge of lncRNA biogenesis, their cell type-specific expression, and their versatile molecular functions is rapidly progressing in all areas of biology. We discuss here these exciting new regulators and highlight an emerging paradigm of lncRNA-mediated control of gene expression in the immune system.'

aS'Dicer-dependent turnover of intergenic transcripts from the human beta-globin gene cluster.\r\nThe widespread occurrence of intergenic transcription in eukaryotes is increasingly evident. Intergenic transcription in the beta-globin gene cluster has been described in murine and human cells, and models for a role in gene and chromatin activation have been proposed. In this study, we analyze intergenic transcription and the chromatin state throughout the human beta-globin gene cluster and find that the data are not consistent with such activation-linked models. Thus, intergenic transcript levels correlate with neither chromatin activation nor globin gene expression. Instead, we find that intergenic transcripts of the beta-globin gene cluster are specifically upregulated in Dicer-deficient cells. This is accompanied by a shift towards more activated chromatin as indicated by changes in histone tail modifications. Our results strongly implicate RNA interference (RNAi)-related mechanisms in regulating intergenic transcription in the human beta-globin gene cluster and further suggest that RNAi-dependent chromatin silencing in vertebrates is not restricted to the centromeres.'

aS'Expression pattern of small nucleolar RNA host genes and long non-coding RNA in X-rays-treated lymphoblastoid cells.\r\nA wide variety of biological effects are induced in cells that are exposed to ionizing radiation. The expression changes of coding mRNA and non-coding micro-RNA have been implicated in irradiated cells. The involvement of other classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in cells recovering from radiation-induced damage has not been examined. Thus, we investigated whether these ncRNA were undergoing changes in cells exposed to ionizing radiation. The modulation of ncRNAs expression was determined in human TK6 (p53 positive) and WTK1 (p53 negative) cells. The snoRNA host genes SNHG1, SNHG6, and SNHG11 were induced in TK6 cells. In WTK1 cells, SNHG1 was induced but SNHG6, and SNHG11 were repressed. SNHG7 was repressed in TK6 cells and was upregulated in WTK1 cells. The lncRNA MALAT1 and SOX2OT were induced in both TK6 and WTK1 cells and SRA1 was induced in TK6 cells only. Interestingly, the MIAT and PIWIL1 were not expressed in TK6 cells before or after the ionizing radiation treatment. The MIAT and PIWIL1 were upregulated in WTK1 cells. This data provides evidence that altered ncRNA expression is a part of the complex stress response operating in radiation-treated cells and this response depends on functional p53.'

aS'Stability, delivery and functions of human sperm RNAs at fertilization.\r\nIncreasing attention has focused on the significance of RNA in sperm, in light of its contribution to the birth and long-term health of a child, role in sperm function and diagnostic potential. As the composition of sperm RNA is in flux, assigning specific roles to individual RNAs presents a significant challenge. For the first time RNA-seq was used to characterize the population of coding and non-coding transcripts in human sperm. Examining RNA representation as a function of multiple methods of library preparation revealed unique features indicative of very specific and stage-dependent maturation and regulation of sperm RNA, illuminating their various transitional roles. Correlation of sperm transcript abundance with epigenetic marks suggested roles for these elements in the pre- and post-fertilization genome. Several classes of non-coding RNAs including lncRNAs, CARs, pri-miRNAs, novel elements and mRNAs have been identified which, based on factors including relative abundance, integrity in sperm, available knockout data of embryonic effect and presence or absence in the unfertilized human oocyte, are likely to be essential male factors critical to early post-fertilization development. The diverse and unique attributes of sperm transcripts that were revealed provides the first detailed analysis of the biology and anticipated clinical significance of spermatozoal RNAs.'

aS'Meta-analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies for Extraversion: Findings from the Genetics of Personality Consortium.\r\nExtraversion is a relatively stable and heritable personality trait associated with numerous psychosocial, lifestyle and health outcomes. Despite its substantial heritability, no genetic variants have been detected in previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies, which may be due to relatively small sample sizes of those studies. Here, we report on a large meta-analysis of GWA studies for extraversion in 63,030 subjects in 29 cohorts. Extraversion item data from multiple personality inventories were harmonized across inventories and cohorts. No genome-wide significant associations were found at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level but there was one significant hit at the gene level for a long non-coding RNA site (LOC101928162). Genome-wide complex trait analysis in two large cohorts showed that the additive variance explained by common SNPs was not significantly different from zero, but polygenic risk scores, weighted using linkage information, significantly predicted extraversion scores in an independent cohort. These results show that extraversion is a highly polygenic personality trait, with an architecture possibly different from other complex human traits, including other personality traits. Future studies are required to further determine which genetic variants, by what modes of gene action, constitute the heritable nature of extraversion.'

aS'Human U19 intron-encoded snoRNA is processed from a long primary transcript that possesses little potential for protein coding.\r\nWhile exons were originally defined as coding regions of split eukaryotic genes, introns have long been considered as mainly noncoding "genetic junk." However, recognition that a large number of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are processed from introns of pre-mRNAs demonstrated that introns may also code for functional RNAs. Moreover, recent characterization of the mammalian UHG gene that encodes eight box C/D intronic snoRNAs suggested that some genes generate functional RNA products exclusively from their intron regions. In this study, we show that the human U19 box H/ACA snoRNA, which is encoded within the second intron of the U19H gene, represents the only functional RNA product generated from the long U19H primary transcript. Splicing of the U19H transcript, instead of giving rise to a defined RNA, produces a population of diverse U19H RNA molecules. Although the first three exons of the U19H gene are preserved in each processed U19H RNA, the 3\' half of the RNA is generated by a series of apparently random splicing events. Because the U19H RNA possesses limited potential for protein coding and shows a predominant nucleoplasmic localization, we suggest that the sole function of the U19H gene is to express the U19 intronic snoRNA. This suggests that, in marked contrast to our previous dogmatic view, genes generating functionally important RNAs exclusively from their intron regions are probably more frequent than has been anticipated.'

aS'Genome-wide analysis of immune system genes by expressed sequence Tag profiling.\r\nProfiling studies of mRNA and microRNA, particularly microarray-based studies, have been extensively used to create compendia of genes that are preferentially expressed in the immune system. In some instances, functional studies have been subsequently pursued. Recent efforts such as the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements have demonstrated the benefit of coupling RNA sequencing analysis with information from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for transcriptomic analysis. However, the full characterization and identification of transcripts that function as modulators of human immune responses remains incomplete. In this study, we demonstrate that an integrated analysis of human ESTs provides a robust platform to identify the immune transcriptome. Beyond recovering a reference set of immune-enriched genes and providing large-scale cross-validation of previous microarray studies, we discovered hundreds of novel genes preferentially expressed in the immune system, including noncoding RNAs. As a result, we have established the Immunogene database, representing an integrated EST road map of gene expression in human immune cells, which can be used to further investigate the function of coding and noncoding genes in the immune system. Using this approach, we have uncovered a unique metabolic gene signature of human macrophages and identified PRDM15 as a novel overexpressed gene in human lymphomas. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of EST profiling as a basis for further deconstruction of physiologic and pathologic immune processes.'

aS'The role of PinX1 in growth control of breast cancer cells and its potential molecular mechanism by mRNA and lncRNA expression profiles screening.\r\nAs a major tumor suppressor gene, the role of PinX1 in breast cancer and its molecular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, overexpression of PinX1 was generated in 3 breast cancer cell lines, and knockdown of PinX1 was performed in a nontumorigenic breast cell line. The regulation of PinX1 on cell proliferation and cell cycle was observed. A microarray-based lncRNA and mRNA expression profile screening was also performed. We found a lower growth rate, G0/G1 phase arrest, and S phase inhibition in the PinX1 overexpressed breast cancer cells, while a higher growth rate, decreased G0/G1 phase, and increased S phase rate in the PinX1 knocked-down nontumorigenic breast cell. A total of 977 mRNAs and 631 lncRNAs were identified as differentially expressed transcripts between PinX1 overexpressed and control MCF-7 cells. Further analysis identified the involvement of these mRNAs in 52 cancer related pathways and various other biological processes. 11 enhancer-like lncRNAs and 25 lincRNAs with their adjacent mRNA pairs were identified as coregulated transcripts. Our results confirmed the role of PinX1 as a major tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer cell lines and provided information for further research on the molecular mechanisms of PinX1 in tumorigenesis.'

aS'Identification and analysis of large intergenic non-coding RNAs regulated by p53 family members through a genome-wide analysis of p53-binding sites.\r\np53 is one of the most important known tumor suppressor genes, and it is inactivated in approximately half of human cancers. p53 family members execute various functions, such as apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest, by modulating transcriptional regulation. Therefore, the direct transcriptional targets of the p53 family must be explored to elucidate the functional mechanisms of family members. To identify the direct transcriptional targets of p53 family members, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation together with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and searched for p53-binding motifs across the entire human genome. Among the identified ChIP-seq peaks, approximately half were located in an intergenic region. Therefore, we assumed large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) to be major targets of the p53 family. Recent reports have revealed that lincRNAs play an important role in various biological and pathological processes, such as development, differentiation, stemness and carcinogenesis. Through a combination of ChIP-seq and in silico analyses, we found 23 lincRNAs that are upregulated by the p53 family. Additionally, knockdown of specific lincRNAs modulated p53-induced apoptosis and promoted the transcription of a gene cluster. Our results suggest that p53 family members, and lincRNAs constitute a complex transcriptional network involved in various biological functions and tumor suppression.'

aS'miR-190a inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatoma cells via targeting the long non-coding RNA treRNA.\r\ntreRNA is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) involved in cancer progression. In this study, we show that miR-190a can silence treRNA post-transcriptionally. Suppression of treRNA by miR-190a led to significant changes of mesenchymal-epithelial transition markers and impaired migration and invasion capability of hepatoma cells. TCGA data indicated that miR-190a exhibited lower expression in hepatoma tissues, especially from patients with vascular tumor invasion, compared to normal tissues. Our results reveal the involvement of miR-190a-treRNA axis in hepatoma progression and shed light on lncRNA-based cancer therapies for hepatoma patients at high risk of metastasis.'

aS'Human 45,X fibroblast transcriptome reveals distinct differentially expressed genes including long noncoding RNAs potentially associated with the pathophysiology of Turner syndrome.\r\nTurner syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality characterized by the absence of whole or part of the X chromosome in females. This X aneuploidy condition is associated with a diverse set of clinical phenotypes such as gonadal dysfunction, short stature, osteoporosis and Type II diabetes mellitus, among others. These phenotypes differ in their severity and penetrance among the affected individuals. Haploinsufficiency for a few X linked genes has been associated with some of these disease phenotypes. RNA sequencing can provide valuable insights to understand molecular mechanism of disease process. In the current study, we have analysed the transcriptome profiles of human untransformed 45,X and 46,XX fibroblast cells and identified differential expression of genes in these two karyotypes. Functional analysis revealed that these differentially expressing genes are associated with bone differentiation, glucose metabolism and gonadal development pathways. We also report differential expression of lincRNAs in X monosomic cells. Our observations provide a basis for evaluation of cellular and molecular mechanism(s) in the establishment of Turner syndrome phenotypes.'

aS'Comprehensive characterization of cancer subtype associated long non-coding RNAs and their clinical implications.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a kind of RNAs with regulation that participate fundamental cellular processes via diverse mechanisms. Despite the potential importance of lncRNAs in multiple kinds of cancer has been well studied, no comprehensive survey of cancer subtype associated lncRNAs. Here, we performed an array-based transcriptional survey of lncRNAs across 150 lung cancer samples comprising both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and 306 breast cancer patients with clear clinical information. In lung cancer, 72 lncRNAs are identified to be associated with tumor subtypes and their functions as well as the associated proteins are predicted by constructing coding-non-coding co-expression network. The results suggest that they are mostly related with epidermis development, cell adhesion and response to stimulus. The validation results show the high concordance and confirmed the robust of the identification results. In breast cancer, we found 3 lncRNA genes are associated with estrogen receptor \xce\xb1 (ER) positive and ER negative subtypes and tumor histologic grade. Survival (Kaplan-Meier) analysis results suggest that the expression pattern of the 3 lncRNAs is significantly correlated with clinical outcomes. The current study provides the first large-scale survey of lncRNAs within cancer subtypes, and may offer new targets for their diagnosis, therapy and prognosis.'

aS'Long non-coding RNA expression profile in atrial fibrillation.\r\nTo investigate the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial tissues from 3 AF patients and 3 non-AF patients that were collected for lncRNA expression microarray analyses to explore the role of lncRNA in the pathogenesis of AF. Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify the main functions of the differentially expressed genes and AF-related pathways. A total of 219 lncRNAs was found to be differentially expressed between AFs and controls. Among them, 156 were upregulated and 63 were downregulated. Eight out of 10 dysregulated lncRNAs such as uc001eqh.1 were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. GO categories, pathway analyses, and interaction network showed a consistent result that differentially expressed genes contribute to the pathogenesis of AF. In conclusion, the findings of our study provide a perspective on lncRNA in AF and the foundation for further study of the biological functions of lncRNAs in AF.'

aS"LUCA-15-encoded sequence variants regulate CD95-mediated apoptosis.\r\nUsing an expression cloning system to discover novel genes involved in apoptosis, we identified a 326 bp bone marrow cDNA fragment (termed Je2) that suppresses, upon transfection, CD95-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat T cells. Sequence homology revealed that Je2 maps to 3p21.3, to an intronic region of the candidate TSG LUCA-15 locus. It represents, in fact, an antisense transcript to the 3'-UTR of two novel splice variants of this gene. Overexpression of sequence representing one of these splice variants (a 2.6 kb cDNA termed Clone 26), inhibited proliferation of Jurkat cells and sensitized them to CD95-mediated apoptosis. This study therefore implicates the LUCA-15 gene locus in the control of apoptosis."

aS"Non-coding landscapes of colorectal cancer.\r\nFor two decades Vogelstein's model has been the paradigm for describing the sequence of molecular changes within protein-coding genes that would lead to overt colorectal cancer (CRC). This model is now too simplistic in the light of recent studies, which have shown that our genome is pervasively transcribed in RNAs other than mRNAs, denominated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The discovery that mutations in genes encoding these RNAs [i.e., microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs] are causally involved in cancer phenotypes has profoundly modified our vision of tumour molecular genetics and pathobiology. By exploiting a wide range of different mechanisms, ncRNAs control fundamental cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis: these data have also confirmed their role as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancer development and progression. The existence of a sophisticated RNA-based regulatory system, which dictates the correct functioning of protein-coding networks, has relevant biological and biomedical consequences. Different miRNAs involved in neoplastic and degenerative diseases exhibit potential predictive and prognostic properties. Furthermore, the key roles of ncRNAs make them very attractive targets for innovative therapeutic approaches. Several recent reports have shown that ncRNAs can be secreted by cells into the extracellular environment (i.e., blood and other body fluids): this suggests the existence of extracellular signalling mechanisms, which may be exploited by cells in physiology and pathology. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant issues on the involvement of cellular and extracellular ncRNAs in disease. We will then specifically describe their involvement in CRC pathobiology and their translational applications to CRC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy."

aS'The Clinical Relevance of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer.\r\nNon-coding RNAs have long been associated with cancer development and progression, and since their earliest discovery, their clinical potential in identifying and characterizing the disease has been pursued. Long non-coding (lncRNAs), a diverse class of RNA transcripts &gt;200 nucleotides in length with limited protein coding potential, has been only modestly studied relative to other categories of non-coding RNAs. However, recent data suggests they too may be important players in cancer. In this article, we consider the value of lncRNAs in the clinical setting, and in particular their potential roles as diagnostic and prognostic markers in cancer. Furthermore, we summarize the most significant studies linking lncRNA expression in human biological samples to cancer outcomes. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and validity of these non-coding RNA transcripts is compared in the various biological compartments in which they have been detected including tumor tissue, whole body fluids and exosomes.'

aS'Constructing lncRNA functional similarity network based on lncRNA-disease associations and disease semantic similarity.\r\nIncreasing evidence has indicated that plenty of lncRNAs play important roles in many critical biological processes. Developing powerful computational models to construct lncRNA functional similarity network based on heterogeneous biological datasets is one of the most important and popular topics in the fields of both lncRNAs and complex diseases. Functional similarity network construction could benefit the model development for both lncRNA function inference and lncRNA-disease association identification. However, little effort has been attempted to analysis and calculate lncRNA functional similarity on a large scale. In this study, based on the assumption that functionally similar lncRNAs tend to be associated with similar diseases, we developed two novel lncRNA functional similarity calculation models (LNCSIM). LNCSIM was evaluated by introducing similarity scores into the model of Laplacian Regularized Least Squares for LncRNA-Disease Association (LRLSLDA) for lncRNA-disease association prediction. As a result, new predictive models improved the performance of LRLSLDA in the leave-one-out cross validation of various known lncRNA-disease associations datasets. Furthermore, some of the predictive results for colorectal cancer and lung cancer were verified by independent biological experimental studies. It is anticipated that LNCSIM could be a useful and important biological tool for human disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.'

aS'Human polymorphisms at long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and association with prostate cancer risk.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), representing a large proportion of non-coding transcripts across the human genome, are evolutionally conserved and biologically functional. At least one-third of the phenotype-related loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are mapped to non-coding intervals. However, the relationships between phenotype-related loci and lncRNAs are largely unknown. Utilizing the 1000 Genomes data, we compared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the sequences of lncRNA and protein-coding genes as defined in the Ensembl database. We further annotated the phenotype-related SNPs reported by GWAS at lncRNA intervals. Because prostate cancer (PCa) risk-related loci were enriched in lncRNAs, we then performed meta-analysis of two existing GWAS for discovery and an additional sample set for replication, revealing PCa risk-related loci at lncRNA regions. The SNP density in regions of lncRNA was similar to that in protein-coding regions, but they were less polymorphic than surrounding regions. Among the 1998 phenotype-related SNPs identified by GWAS, 52 loci were located directly in lncRNA intervals with a 1.5-fold enrichment compared with the entire genome. More than a 5-fold enrichment was observed for eight PCa risk-related loci in lncRNA genes. We also identified a new PCa risk-related SNP rs3787016 in an lncRNA region at 19q13 (per allele odds ratio = 1.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-1.27) with P value of 7.22 \xc3\x97 10(-7). lncRNAs may be important for interpreting and mining GWAS data. However, the catalog of lncRNAs needs to be better characterized in order to fully evaluate the relationship of phenotype-related loci with lncRNAs.'

aS'Genomic rearrangements at the FRA2H common fragile site frequently involve non-homologous recombination events across LTR and L1(LINE) repeats.\r\nCommon fragile sites (cFSs) are non-random chromosomal regions that are prone to breakage under conditions of replication stress. DNA damage and chromosomal alterations at cFSs appear to be critical events in the development of various human diseases, especially carcinogenesis. Despite the growing interest in understanding the nature of cFS instability, only a few cFSs have been molecularly characterised. In this study, we fine-mapped the location of FRA2H using six-colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation and showed that it is one of the most active cFSs in the human genome. FRA2H encompasses approximately 530 kb of a gene-poor region containing a novel large intergenic non-coding RNA gene (AC097500.2). Using custom-designed array comparative genomic hybridisation, we detected gross and submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements involving FRA2H in a panel of 54 neuroblastoma, colon and breast cancer cell lines. The genomic alterations frequently involved different classes of long terminal repeats and long interspersed nuclear elements. An analysis of breakpoint junction sequence motifs predominantly revealed signatures of microhomology-mediated non-homologous recombination events. Our data provide insight into the molecular structure of cFSs and sequence motifs affected by their activation in cancer. Identifying cFS sequences will accelerate the search for DNA biomarkers and targets for individualised therapies.'

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the major histological type of esophageal cancer in Eastern Asian countries. Several types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function as key epigenetic regulators of gene expression and are implicated in various physiological processes. Unambiguous evidence indicates that dysregulation of ncRNAs is deeply implicated in carcinogenesis, cancer progression and metastases of various cancers, including ESCC. The current review summarizes recent findings on the ncRNA-mediated mechanisms underlying the characteristic behaviors of ESCC that will help support the development of biomarkers and the design of novel therapeutic strategies.'

aS'Single-Cell XIST Expression in Human Preimplantation Embryos and Newly Reprogrammed Female Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.\r\nThe process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) during reprogramming to produce human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as during the extensive programming that occurs in human preimplantation development, is not well-understood. Indeed, studies of XCI during reprogramming to iPSCs report cells with two active X chromosomes and/or cells with one inactive X chromosome. Here, we examine expression of the long noncoding RNA, XIST, in single cells of human embryos through the oocyte-to-embryo transition and in new mRNA reprogrammed iPSCs. We show that XIST is first expressed beginning at the 4-cell stage, coincident with the onset of embryonic genome activation in an asynchronous manner. Additionally, we report that mRNA reprogramming produces iPSCs that initially express XIST transcript; however, expression is rapidly lost with culture. Loss of XIST and H3K27me3 enrichment at the inactive X chromosome at late passage results in X chromosome expression changes. Our data may contribute to applications in disease modeling and potential translational applications of female stem cells.'

aS'NRAV, a long noncoding RNA, modulates antiviral responses through suppression of interferon-stimulated gene transcription.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) modulate various biological processes, but their role in host antiviral responses is largely unknown. Here we identify a lncRNA as a key regulator of antiviral innate immunity. Following from the observation that a lncRNA that we call negative regulator of antiviral response (NRAV) was dramatically downregulated during infection with several viruses, we ectopically expressed NRAV in human cells or transgenic mice and found that it significantly promotes influenza A virus (IAV) replication and virulence. Conversely, silencing NRAV suppressed IAV replication and virus production, suggesting that reduction of NRAV is part of the host antiviral innate immune response to virus infection. NRAV negatively regulates the initial transcription of multiple critical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including IFITM3 and MxA, by affecting histone modification of these genes. Our results provide evidence for a lncRNA in modulating the antiviral interferon response.'

aS"PVT1 dependence in cancer with MYC copy-number increase.\r\n'Gain' of supernumerary copies of the 8q24.21 chromosomal region has been shown to be common in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. The well-characterized myelocytomatosis (MYC) oncogene resides in the 8q24.21 region and is consistently co-gained with an adjacent 'gene desert' of approximately 2\xe2\x80\x89megabases that contains the long non-coding RNA gene PVT1, the CCDC26 gene candidate and the GSDMC gene. Whether low copy-number gain of one or more of these genes drives neoplasia is not known. Here we use chromosome engineering in mice to show that a single extra copy of either the Myc gene or the region encompassing Pvt1, Ccdc26 and Gsdmc fails to advance cancer measurably, whereas a single supernumerary segment encompassing all four genes successfully promotes cancer. Gain of PVT1 long non-coding RNA expression was required for high MYC protein levels in 8q24-amplified human cancer cells. PVT1 RNA and MYC protein expression correlated in primary human tumours, and copy number of PVT1 was co-increased in more than 98% of MYC-copy-increase cancers. Ablation of PVT1 from MYC-driven colon cancer line HCT116 diminished its tumorigenic potency. As MYC protein has been refractory to small-molecule inhibition, the dependence of high MYC protein levels on PVT1 long non-coding RNA provides a much needed therapeutic target."

In addition, EMX2 maps to a region of allelic deletion corresponding to a putative endometrial tumor suppressor at 10q26. We now report another polyadenylated transcript that is transcribed on the strand opposite to EMX2 and overlaps with the EMX2 transcript. This transcript was designated EMX2OS (OS, opposite strand), and an orthologous transcript present at the murine Emx2 locus was designated Emx2os. Alternative splicing to generate transcripts with varying 5' sequences was detected in the human but not the mouse. Neither ortholog contains a significant open reading frame, nor is primary sequence conserved between the two species. The sense and antisense transcripts display coordinate expression in that EMX2 and EMX2OS are abundant in normal postmenopausal endometrium, reduced in premenopausal endometrium, and absent or reduced in a majority of primary endometrial tumors. EMX2, EMX2OS, Emx2, and Emx2os are abundant in the uterine endometrium, with sense and antisense transcripts exhibiting identical expression patterns. Conservation of functional human and murine EMX2 antisense genes, of overlap between the sense and the antisense transcripts, and of identical cellular expression patterns suggests a biological function for EMX2OS, presumably to regulate EMX2."

aS"SET1A Cooperates With CUDR to Promote Liver Cancer Growth and Hepatocyte-like Stem Cell Malignant Transformation Epigenetically.\r\nLong noncoding RNA CUDR plays an important role during tumorigenesis. Herein, we demonstrate that SET1A cooperates with CUDR to accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis and promote malignant transformation of hepatocyte-like stem cells. Mechanistically, CUDR enhances the phosphorylation of RB1, C-myc expression, and the interplay between the SET1A and pRB1. Notably, CUDR acts as a sponge cushion that shows a link between SET1A and pRB1, producing a activated pRB1-SET1A complex. On the other hand, the pRB1-SET1A complex may carry methyls(me) to occupy the position of H3K4, resulting in specific tri-methylation of forth lysine of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Thereby, the H3K4me3 loads on the TRF2 promoter region which causes the TRF2 overexpression. Ultimately, the excessive TRF2 binds to telomere repeat DNA, prolonging the telomere length. These findings provide the first demonstration that SET1A cooperates with CUDR to play a positive potential role during hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatocyte-like stem cells' malignant transformation epigenetically."

aS'LncRNA-HIT Functions as an Epigenetic Regulator of Chondrogenesis through Its Recruitment of p100/CBP Complexes.\r\nGene expression profiling in E 11 mouse embryos identified high expression of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), LNCRNA-HIT in the undifferentiated limb mesenchyme, gut, and developing genital tubercle. In the limb mesenchyme, LncRNA-HIT was found to be retained in the nucleus, forming a complex with p100 and CBP. Analysis of the genome-wide distribution of LncRNA-HIT-p100/CBP complexes by ChIRP-seq revealed LncRNA-HIT associated peaks at multiple loci in the murine genome. Ontological analysis of the genes contacted by LncRNA-HIT-p100/CBP complexes indicate a primary role for these loci in chondrogenic differentiation. Functional analysis using siRNA-mediated reductions in LncRNA-HIT or p100 transcripts revealed a significant decrease in expression of many of the LncRNA-HIT-associated loci. LncRNA-HIT siRNA treatments also impacted the ability of the limb mesenchyme to form cartilage, reducing mesenchymal cell condensation and the formation of cartilage nodules. Mechanistically the LncRNA-HIT siRNA treatments impacted pro-chondrogenic gene expression by reducing H3K27ac or p100 activity, confirming that LncRNA-HIT is essential for chondrogenic differentiation in the limb mesenchyme. Taken together, these findings reveal a fundamental epigenetic mechanism functioning during early limb development, using LncRNA-HIT and its associated proteins to promote the expression of multiple genes whose products are necessary for the formation of cartilage.'

aS'Two novel splice variants of SOX2OT, SOX2OT-S1, and SOX2OT-S2 are coupregulated with SOX2 and OCT4 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as new regulators of stem cell pluripotency and tumorigenesis. The SOX2 gene, a master regulator of pluripotency, is embedded within the third intron of a lncRNA known as SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT). SOX2OT has been suspected to participate in regulation of SOX2 expression and/or other related processes; nevertheless, its potential involvement in tumor initiation and/or progression is unclear. Here, we have evaluated a possible correlation between expression patterns of SOX2OT and those of master regulators of pluripotency, SOX2 and OCT4, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissue samples. We have also examined its potential function in the human embryonic carcinoma stem cell line, NTERA2 (NT2), which highly expresses SOX2OT, SOX2, and OCT4. Our data revealed a significant coupregulation of SOX2OT along with SOX2 and OCT4 in tumor samples, compared to the non-tumor tissues obtained from the margin of same tumors. We also identified two novel splice variants of SOX2OT (SOX2OT-S1 and SOX2OT-S2) which coupregulated with SOX2 and OCT4 in ESCCs. Suppressing SOX2OT variants caused a profound alteration in cell cycle distribution, including a 5.9 and 6.9 time increase in sub-G1 phase of cell cycle for SOX2OT-S1 and SOX2OT-S2, respectively. The expression of all variants was significantly diminished, upon the induction of neural differentiation in NT2 cells, suggesting their potential functional links to the undifferentiated state of the cells. Our data suggest a part for SOX2OT spliced variants in tumor initiation and/or progression as well as regulating pluripotent state of stem cells.'

aS'Genetics of RA susceptibility, what comes next?\r\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been used to great effect to identify genetic susceptibility loci for complex disease. A series of GWAS and meta-analyses have informed the discovery of over 100 loci for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In common with findings in other autoimmune diseases the lead signals for the majority of these loci do not map to known gene sequences. In order to realise the benefit of investment in GWAS studies it is vital we determine how disease associated alleles function to influence disease processes. This is leading to rapid development in our knowledge as to the function of non-coding regions of the genome. Here we consider possible functional mechanisms for intergenic RA-associated variants which lie within lncRNA sequences.'

aS'A strategy for probing the function of noncoding RNAs finds a repressor of NFAT.\r\nNoncoding RNA molecules (ncRNAs) have been implicated in numerous biological processes including transcriptional regulation and the modulation of protein function. Yet, in spite of the apparent abundance of ncRNA, little is known about the biological role of the projected thousands of ncRNA genes present in the human genome. To facilitate functional analysis of these RNAs, we have created an arrayed library of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against 512 evolutionarily conserved putative ncRNAs and, via cell-based assays, we have begun to determine their roles in cellular pathways. Using this system, we have identified an ncRNA repressor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which interacts with multiple proteins including members of the importin-beta superfamily and likely functions as a specific regulator of NFAT nuclear trafficking.'

aS'Multidrug-Resistance Related Long Non-Coding RNA Expression Profile Analysis of Gastric Cancer.\r\nThe effect of chemotherapy of gastric cancer (GC) remains very poor because of multidrug resistance (MDR). However, the mechanisms underlying MDR of GC remains far from fully understood. The aim of this study is to illustrate the potential mechanisms of the MDR of GC at mainly the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) level. In this study, GC cell line, SGC7901, and two MDR sublines, SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR were subjected to an lncRNA microarray analysis. Bioinformatics and verification experiments were performed to investigate the potential lncRNAs involved in the development of MDR. Pathway analysis indicated that 15 pathways corresponded to down-regulated transcripts and that 20 pathways corresponded to up-regulated transcripts (p-value cut-off is 0.05). GO analysis showed that the highest enriched GOs targeted by up-regulated transcripts were "system development" and the highest esenriched GOs targeted by the down-regulated transcripts were "sterol biosynthetic process". Our study is the first to interrogate differentially expressed lncRNAs in human GC cell line and MDR sublines and indicates that lncRNAs are worthwhile for further study to be the novel candidate biomarkers for the clinical diagnosis of MDR and potential targets for further therapy.'

aS'Co-expression Network Analysis of Human lncRNAs and Cancer Genes.\r\nWe used gene co-expression network analysis to functionally annotate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identify their potential cancer associations. The integrated microarray data set from our previous study was used to extract the expression profiles of 1,865 lncRNAs. Known cancer genes were compiled from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and UniProt databases. Co-expression analysis identified a list of previously uncharacterized lncRNAs that showed significant correlation in expression with core cancer genes. To further annotate the lncRNAs, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which resulted in 37 co-expression modules. Three biologically interesting modules were analyzed in depth. Two of the modules showed relatively high expression in blood and brain tissues, whereas the third module was found to be downregulated in blood cells. Hub lncRNA genes and enriched functional annotation terms were identified within the modules. The results suggest the utility of this approach as well as potential roles of uncharacterized lncRNAs in leukemia and neuroblastoma.'

aS'The paternally imprinted DLK1-GTL2 locus is differentially methylated in embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.\r\nParental imprinting of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) contributes to appropriate expression of several developmentally important genes from paternally or maternally derived chromosomes. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and is associated with altered expression of certain parentally imprinted genes. As previously reported, RMS cells display loss of imprinting (LOI) of the DMR at the IGF2-H19 locus, resulting in insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) transcription from both paternally and maternally inherited chromosomes, and overall IGF2 overexpression. As the DLK1-GTL2 locus is structurally similar to the IGF2-H19 locus, the status of parental imprinting of the DLK1-GTL2 locus was studied in RMS. We observed that while both embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS and ARMS, respectively) show LOI of the DMR at the IGF2-H19 locus, imprinting of the DMR at the DLK1-GTL2 locus varies in association with the histological subtype of RMS. We found that, while ERMS tumors consistently show LOI of the DMR at the DLK1-GTL2 locus, ARMS tumors have erasure of imprinting (EOI) at this locus. These changes in imprinting status of the DLK1-GTL2 locus result in a higher GTL2/DLK1 mRNA ratio in ARMS as compared to ERMS. This difference in imprinting elucidates a novel genetic difference between these two RMS subtypes and may provide a potential diagnostic tool to distinguish between these subtypes.'

aS'Long and noncoding RNAs (lnc-RNAs) determine androgen receptor dependent gene expression in prostate cancer growth in vivo.\r\nHyperactive androgen receptor (AR) activity remains a key determinant of the onset and progression of prostate cancer and resistance to current therapies. The mechanisms governing castrate resistant prostate cancer are poorly understood, but defining these molecular events is essential in order to impact deaths from prostate cancer. Yang et al. demonstrate that two lnc-RNAs known to be overexpressed in therapy resistant prostate cancer, PRNCR1 (also known as PCAT8) and PCGEM1, bound to the AR to enhance ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR gene expression and proliferation of prostate cancer cells.1 The sequence of these interactions involved the binding of PRNCR1 to the acetylated AR and a subsequent association of DOT1L, which was required for the sequential recruitment of the lncRNA PCGEM1 to the AR amino terminus, which in turn was methylated by DOT1L.'

aS'Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs in autistic brain.\r\nThe autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a significant hereditary component, but the implicated genetic loci are heterogeneous and complex. Consequently, there is a gap in understanding how diverse genomic aberrations all result in one clinical ASD phenotype. Gene expression studies from autism brain tissue have demonstrated that aberrantly expressed protein-coding genes may converge onto common molecular pathways, potentially reconciling the strong heritability and shared clinical phenotypes with the genomic heterogeneity of the disorder. However, the regulation of gene expression is extremely complex and governed by many mechanisms, including noncoding RNAs. Yet no study in ASD brain tissue has assessed for changes in regulatory long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which represent a large proportion of the human transcriptome, and actively modulate mRNA expression. To assess if aberrant expression of lncRNAs may play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of ASD, we profiled over 33,000 annotated lncRNAs and 30,000 mRNA transcripts from postmortem brain tissue of autistic and control prefrontal cortex and cerebellum by microarray. We detected over 200 differentially expressed lncRNAs in ASD, which were enriched for genomic regions containing genes related to neurodevelopment and psychiatric disease. Additionally, comparison of differences in expression of mRNAs between prefrontal cortex and cerebellum within individual donors showed ASD brains had more transcriptional homogeneity. Moreover, this was also true of the lncRNA transcriptome. Our results suggest that further investigation of lncRNA expression in autistic brain may further elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder.'

aS'Long noncoding RNA: a new player of heart failure?\r\nOne the most important discoveries of the post-genomic era is that a large fraction of the genome transcribes a heterogeneous population of noncoding RNAs (ncRNA). ncRNAs shorter than 200 nucleotides are usually identified as short/small ncRNAs--examples include PIWI-interacting RNAs, small interfering RNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs)--whereas those longer than 200 nucleotides are classified as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). These molecules are emerging as important regulators of cellular process, such as development, differentiation, and metabolism. Not surprisingly, ncRNAs are involved also in human diseases, such as cancer and metabolic and neuronal disorders. Although the role of miRNAs is being largely investigated in cardiovascular biology, little is known about other classes of ncRNA in this field. However, recent reports have started to reveal the importance of lncRNA in heart development and suggest also an involvement in heart failure. Here, we will discuss these reports and the therapeutic potential of lncRNA for heart failure.'

aS"Pulmonary agenesis: a predictor of ipsilateral malformations.\r\nPulmonary agenesis is a rare malformation that can be isolated or associated with other anomalies. We became interested in pulmonary agenesis after evaluation of a child with right pulmonary agenesis, an unlobed left lung, bilateral cleft lip and palate, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia, bilateral microtia, bilateral radial ray hypoplasia, horseshoe kidney, and complex congenital heart disease. A review of the occurrence of pulmonary agenesis with other congenital anomalies uncovered a striking association with ipsilateral radial ray defects and/or hemifacial microsomia. The presence of bilateral facial or radial ray anomalies was indicative of bilateral pulmonary involvement. A review of the cases of pulmonary agenesis and associated anomalies at the Children's Hospital and Medical Center confirmed the association of pulmonary agenesis and ipsilateral involvement of face and/or radial ray. The association of pulmonary agenesis and ipsilateral malformations may shed light on its pathogenesis. Although the cause of these associated anomalies remains unclear, abnormalities in the development of the aortic arches during embryogenesis is an attractive hypothesis."

aS"MiRNA-192 [corrected] and miRNA-204 Directly Suppress lncRNA HOTTIP and Interrupt GLS1-Mediated Glutaminolysis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\r\nAccumulated evidence demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. However, it is still largely unknown how these lncRNAs were regulated by small ncRNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), at the post-transcriptional level. We here use lncRNA HOTTIP as an example to study how miRNAs impact lncRNAs expression and its biological significance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LncRNA HOTTIP is a vital oncogene in HCC, one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. In the current study, we identified miR-192 and miR-204 as two microRNAs (miRNAs) suppressing HOTTIP expression via the Argonaute 2 (AGO2)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in HCC. Interaction between miR-192 or miR-204 and HOTTIP were further confirmed using dual luciferase reporter gene assays. Consistent with this notion, a significant negative correlation between these miRNAs and HOTTIP exists in HCC tissue specimens. Interestingly, the dysregulation of the three ncRNAs was associated with overall survival of HCC patients. In addition, the posttranscriptional silencing of HOTTIP by miR-192, miR-204 or HOTTIP siRNAs could significantly suppress viability of HCC cells. On the contrary, antagonizing endogenous miR-192 or miR-204 led to increased HOTTIP expression and stimulated cell proliferation. In vivo mouse xenograft model also support the tumor suppressor role of both miRNAs. Besides the known targets (multiple 5' end HOX A genes, i.e. HOXA13), glutaminase (GLS1) was identified as a potential downstream target of the miR-192/-204-HOTTIP axis in HCC. Considering glutaminolysis as a crucial hallmark of cancer cells and significantly inhibited cell viability after silencingGLS1, we speculate that the miR-192/-204-HOTTIP axis may interrupt HCC glutaminolysis through GLS1 inhibition. These results elucidate that the miR-192/-204-HOTTIP axis might be an important molecular pathway during hepatic cell tumorigenesis. Our data in clinical HCC samples highlight miR-192, miR-204 and HOTTIP with prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications."

aS'Long non-coding RNA normalisers in human brain tissue.\r\nThe family of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is of increasing scientific interest as there is\xc2\xa0emerging evidence, that lncRNAs are of essential importance for transcriptional and translational control, genomic imprinting and regulation of normal development as well as neuronal plasticity. As the generation of reliable expression profiles requires adequate normalisers, it is of fundamental importance to determine suitable references for lncRNA studies. However, to date no systematic analysis of potential\xc2\xa0lncRNA normalisers has been performed on human postmortem brain tissue\xc2\xa0samples. In this study, we investigated three different brain regions (cortex, white matter, and cerebellum) of human postmortem tissue and analysed the expression stability of 90 lncRNAs. Bioinformatical analysis was performed to identify stably expressed lncRNAs. Subsequently, lncRNAs were classified according to their stability values using the NormFinder algorithm. We identified 30 suitable\xc2\xa0normalisers in cortex, 22 in white matter, and 41 in cerebellum. In addition, there were 13 suitable normalisers for studies comparing cortex and white matter, 25 for studies\xc2\xa0comparing cortex and cerebellum and 7 for studies\xc2\xa0comparing white matter and cerebellum. 5 lncRNAs (LUST, IGF2AS (family), 7SK, HOXA6as, NDM29) showed stable expression in all investigated brain regions. A subsequent analysis of the influence of postmortem intervals (PMI) on expression of lncRNAs revealed that expression levels\xc2\xa0of the newly identified\xc2\xa05 universal lncRNA\xc2\xa0normalisers are stable within PMI of up to 27\xc2\xa0h. Thus, these 5\xc2\xa0lncRNAs may be applicable as references for accurate normalisation of lncRNA profiling in multiple brain regions during long PMI, enabling the generation of\xc2\xa0highly reproducible datasets in lncRNA studies of the human brain.'

aS'Epigenetics and Epilepsy.\r\nEpigenetic processes in the brain involve the transfer of information arising from short-lived cellular signals and changes in neuronal activity into lasting effects on gene expression. Key molecular mediators of epigenetics include methylation of DNA, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. Emerging findings in animal models and human brain tissue reveal that epilepsy and epileptogenesis are associated with changes to each of these contributors to the epigenome. Understanding and influencing the molecular mechanisms controlling epigenetic change could open new avenues for treatment. DNA methylation, particularly hypermethylation, has been found to increase within gene body regions and interference with DNA methylation in epilepsy can change gene expression profiles and influence epileptogenesis. Posttranscriptional modification of histones, including transient as well as sustained changes to phosphorylation and acetylation, have been reported, which appear to influence gene expression. Finally, roles have emerged for noncoding RNAs in brain excitability and seizure thresholds, including microRNA and long noncoding RNA. Together, research supports strong effects of epigenetics influencing gene expression in epilepsy, suggesting future therapeutic approaches to manipulate epigenetic processes to treat or prevent epilepsy.'

aS'A genome-wide association study of prostate cancer in West African men.\r\nAge-adjusted mortality rates for prostate cancer are higher for African-American men compared with those of European ancestry. Recent data suggest that West African men also have elevated risk for prostate cancer relative to European men. Genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer could account for part of this difference. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in West African men in the Ghana Prostate Study. Association testing was performed using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for age and genetic ancestry for 474 prostate cancer cases and 458 population-based controls on the Illumina HumanOmni-5 Quad BeadChip. The most promising association was at 10p14 within an intron of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA RP11-543F8.2) 360\xc2\xa0kb centromeric of GATA3 (p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa01.29E-7). In sub-analyses, SNPs at 5q31.3 were associated with high Gleason score (\xe2\x89\xa57) cancers, the strongest of which was a missense SNP in PCDHA1 (rs34575154, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa03.66E-8), and SNPs at Xq28 (rs985081, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa08.66E-9) and 6q21 (rs2185710, p\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa05.95E-8) were associated with low Gleason score (&lt;7) cancers. We sought to validate our findings in silico in the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer GWAS Consortium, but only one SNP, at 10p14, replicated at p\xc2\xa0&lt;\xc2\xa00.05. Of the 90 prostate cancer loci reported from studies of men of European, Asian or African-American ancestry, we were able to test 81 in the Ghana Prostate Study, and 10 of these replicated at p\xc2\xa0&lt;\xc2\xa00.05. Further genetic studies of prostate cancer in West African men are needed to confirm our promising susceptibility loci.'

aS'X-inactivation and X-reactivation: epigenetic hallmarks of mammalian reproduction and pluripotent stem cells.\r\nX-chromosome inactivation is an epigenetic hallmark of mammalian development. Chromosome-wide regulation of the X-chromosome is essential in embryonic and germ cell development. In the male germline, the X-chromosome goes through meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, and the chromosome-wide silencing is maintained from meiosis into spermatids before the transmission to female embryos. In early female mouse embryos, X-inactivation is imprinted to occur on the paternal X-chromosome, representing the epigenetic programs acquired in both parental germlines. Recent advances revealed that the inactive X-chromosome in both females and males can be dissected into two elements: repeat elements versus unique coding genes. The inactive paternal X in female preimplantation embryos is reactivated in the inner cell mass of blastocysts in order to subsequently allow the random form of X-inactivation in the female embryo, by which both Xs have an equal chance of being inactivated. X-chromosome reactivation is regulated by pluripotency factors and also occurs in early female germ cells and in pluripotent stem cells, where X-reactivation is a stringent marker of naive ground state pluripotency. Here we summarize recent progress in the study of X-inactivation and X-reactivation during mammalian reproduction and development as well as in pluripotent stem cells.'

aS'PCGEM1 stimulates proliferation of osteoarthritic synoviocytes by acting as a sponge for miR-770.\r\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play important roles in cellular metabolism and development. Various diseases have been associated with aberrant expression of lncRNAs and the related dysregulation of mRNAs. An lncRNA profiling assay was carried out to identify the key lncRNA in osteoarthritic human synoviocytes; the results revealed that prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) was significantly overexpressed in osteoarthritic synoviocytes. Exogenous overexpression of PCGEM1 inhibited apoptosis, induced autophagy, and stimulated the proliferation of human synoviocytes. The increased expression of PCGEM1 in human synoviocytes also suppressed the expression of miR-770. Transfection of the miR-770 precursor resulted in reduced proliferation, and induced apoptosis of human synoviocytes. This effect of miR-770 expression was reversed by co-introduction of PCGEM1. Target validation showed a direct binding between PCGEM1 and miR-770. We demonstrate that PCGEM1 act as sponge lncRNA for miR-770 that regulates proliferation/apoptosis and autophagy, and suggest PCGEM1 as possible target for OA therapy.'

aS"The SCA8 transcript is an antisense RNA to a brain-specific transcript encoding a novel actin-binding protein (KLHL1).\r\nSpinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat that is transcribed as part of an untranslated RNA. As a step towards understanding the molecular pathology of SCA8, we have defined the genomic organization of the SCA8 RNA transcripts and assembled a 166 kb segment of genomic sequence containing the repeat. The most striking feature of the SCA8 transcripts is that the most 5' exon is transcribed through the first exon of another gene that is transcribed in the opposite orientation. This gene arrangement suggests that the SCA8 transcript is an endogenous antisense RNA that overlaps the transcription and translation start sites as well as the first splice donor sequence of the sense gene. The sense transcript encodes a 748 amino acid protein with a predicted domain structure typical of a family of actin-organizing proteins related to the Drosophila Kelch gene, and so has been given the name Kelch-like 1 (KLHL1). We have identified the full-length cDNA sequence for both the human and mouse KLHLI genes, and have elucidated the general genomic organization of the human gene. The predicted open reading frame and promoter region are highly conserved, and both genes are primarily expressed in specific brain tissues, including the cerebellum, the tissue most affected by SCA8. Transfection studies with epitope-tagged KLHL1 demonstrate that the protein localizes to the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may play a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton of the brain cells in which it is expressed."

aS"Pan-cancer transcriptome analysis reveals long noncoding RNAs with conserved function.\r\nA growing number of gene-centric studies have highlighted the emerging significance of lncRNAs in cancer. However, these studies primarily focus on a single cancer type. Therefore, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of lncRNAs comparing tumor and matched normal expression levels using RNA-Seq data from \xe2\x88\xbc 3,000 patients in 8 solid tumor types. While the majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs display tissue-specific expression we discovered 229 lncRNAs with outlier or differential expression across multiple cancers, which we refer to as 'onco-lncRNAs'. Due to their consistent altered expression, we hypothesize that these onco-lncRNAs may have conserved oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions across cancers. To address this, we associated the onco-lncRNAs in biological processes based on their co-expressed protein coding genes. To validate our predictions, we experimentally confirmed cell growth dependence of 2 novel oncogenic lncRNAs, onco-lncRNA-3 and onco-lncRNA-12, and a previously identified lncRNA CCAT1. Overall, we discovered lncRNAs that may have broad oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles that could significantly advance our understanding of cancer lncRNA biology."

aS'Coupling of X-chromosome reactivation with the pluripotent stem cell state.\r\nX-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals is a dramatic example of epigenetic gene regulation, which entails the silencing of an entire chromosome through a wide range of mechanisms involving noncoding RNAs, chromatin-modifications, and DNA-methylation. While XCI is associated with the differentiated cell state, it is reversed by X-chromosome reactivation (XCR) ex vivo in pluripotent stem cells and in vivo in the early mouse embryo and the germline. Critical in the regulation of XCI vs. XCR is the X-inactivation center, a multigene locus on the X-chromosome harboring several long noncoding RNA genes including, most prominently, Xist and Tsix. These genes, which sit at the top of the XCI hierarchy, are by themselves controlled by pluripotency factors, coupling XCR with the na\xc3\xafve pluripotent stem cell state. In this point-of-view article we review the latest findings regarding this intricate relationship between cell differentiation state and epigenetic control of the X-chromosome. In particular, we discuss the emerging picture of complex multifactorial regulatory mechanisms, ensuring both a fine-tuned and robust X-reactivation process.'

aS'Pervasive transcription of the human genome produces thousands of previously unidentified long intergenic noncoding RNAs.\r\nKnown protein coding gene exons compose less than 3% of the human genome. The remaining 97% is largely uncharted territory, with only a small fraction characterized. The recent observation of transcription in this intergenic territory has stimulated debate about the extent of intergenic transcription and whether these intergenic RNAs are functional. Here we directly observed with a large set of RNA-seq data covering a wide array of human tissue types that the majority of the genome is indeed transcribed, corroborating recent observations by the ENCODE project. Furthermore, using de novo transcriptome assembly of this RNA-seq data, we found that intergenic regions encode far more long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) than previously described, helping to resolve the discrepancy between the vast amount of observed intergenic transcription and the limited number of previously known lincRNAs. In total, we identified tens of thousands of putative lincRNAs expressed at a minimum of one copy per cell, significantly expanding upon prior lincRNA annotation sets. These lincRNAs are specifically regulated and conserved rather than being the product of transcriptional noise. In addition, lincRNAs are strongly enriched for trait-associated SNPs suggesting a new mechanism by which intergenic trait-associated regions may function. These findings will enable the discovery and interrogation of novel intergenic functional elements.'

aS'Regulation of the Th1 genomic locus from Ifng through Tmevpg1 by T-bet.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), critical regulators of protein-coding genes, are likely to be coexpressed with neighboring protein-coding genes in the genome. How the genome integrates signals to achieve coexpression of lncRNA genes and neighboring protein-coding genes is not well understood. The lncRNA Tmevpg1 (NeST, Ifng-AS1) is critical for Th1-lineage-specific expression of Ifng and is coexpressed with Ifng. In this study, we show that T-bet guides epigenetic remodeling of Tmevpg1 proximal and distal enhancers, leading to recruitment of stimulus-inducible transcription factors, NF-\xce\xbaB and Ets-1, to the locus. Activities of Tmevpg1-specific enhancers and Tmevpg1 transcription are dependent upon NF-\xce\xbaB. Thus, we propose that T-bet stimulates epigenetic remodeling of Tmevpg1-specific enhancers and Ifng-specific enhancers to achieve Th1-lineage-specific expression of Ifng.'

aS'A new GWAS and meta-analysis with 1000Genomes imputation identifies novel risk variants for colorectal cancer.\r\nGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified 23 susceptibility loci thus far. Analyses of previously conducted GWAS indicate additional risk loci are yet to be discovered. To identify novel CRC susceptibility loci, we conducted a new GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with five published GWAS (totalling 7,577 cases and 9,979 controls of European ancestry), imputing genotypes utilising the 1000 Genomes Project. The combined analysis identified new, significant associations with CRC at 1p36.2 marked by rs72647484 (minor allele frequency [MAF]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.09) near CDC42 and WNT4 (P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.21\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8910(-8), odds ratio [OR]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.21 ) and at 16q24.1 marked by rs16941835 (MAF\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.21, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x895.06\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8910(-8); OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.15) within the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-58A18.1 and ~500\xe2\x80\x89kb from the nearest coding gene FOXL1. Additionally we identified a promising association at 10p13 with rs10904849 intronic to CUBN (MAF\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.32, P\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x897.01\xe2\x80\x89\xc3\x97\xe2\x80\x8910(-8); OR\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891.14). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC. Additionally, our analysis further demonstrates that imputation can be used to exploit GWAS data to identify novel disease-causing variants.'

aS'High-resolution map and imprinting analysis of the Gtl2-Dnchc1 domain on mouse chromosome 12.\r\nThe imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 region on mouse chromosome 12 contains six imprinted genes and a number of maternally expressed snoRNAs and miRNAs. Here we present a high-resolution sequence analysis of the 1.1-Mb segment telomeric to Gtl2 in mouse and a homology comparison to the human. Ppp2r5c and Dnchc1 at the telomeric end of the analyzed sequence are biallelically expressed, suggesting that the imprinted domain does not extend beyond the paternally expressed Dio3 gene. RT-PCR experiments support the predicted presence of a maternally expressed intergenic transcript(s) encompassing Gtl2, Rian, and Mirg. These maternally expressed genes, and also the intergenic transcript(s), show pronounced expression in the adult mouse brain, whereas the paternally transcribed Dio3 and the nonimprinted Ppp2r5c and Dnchc1 are expressed in different tissues. Hence, tissue-specific coregulation of maternally expressed genes might be an important feature of this domain.'

aS"Enrichment of Human Stem-Like Prostate Cells with s-SHIP Promoter Activity Uncovers a Role in Stemness for the Long Noncoding RNA H19.\r\nUnderstanding normal and cancer stem cells should provide insights into the origin of prostate cancer and their mechanisms of resistance to current treatment strategies. In this study, we isolated and characterized stem-like cells present in the immortalized human prostate cell line, RWPE-1. We used a reporter system with green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the promoter of s-SHIP (for stem-SH2-domain-containing 5'-inositol phosphatase) whose stem cell-specific expression has been previously shown. We observed that s-SHIP-GFP-expressing RWPE-1 cells showed stem cell characteristics such as increased expression of stem cell surface markers (CD44, CD166, TROP2) and pluripotency transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2), and enhanced sphere-forming capacity and resistance to arsenite-induced cell death. Concomitant increased expression of the long noncoding RNA H19 was observed, which prompted us to investigate a putative role in stemness for this oncofetal gene. Targeted suppression of H19 with siRNA decreased Oct4 and Sox2 gene expression and colony-forming potential in RWPE-1 cells. Conversely, overexpression of H19 significantly increased gene expression of these two transcription factors and the sphere-forming capacity of RWPE-1 cells. Analysis of H19 expression in various prostate and mammary human cell lines revealed similarities with Sox2 expression, suggesting that a functional relationship may exist between H19 and Sox2. Collectively, we provide the first evidence that s-SHIP-GFP promoter reporter offers a unique marker for the enrichment of human stem-like cell populations and highlight a role in stemness for the long noncoding RNA H19."

aS"Aberrant silencing of imprinted genes on chromosome 12qF1 in mouse induced pluripotent stem cells.\r\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been generated by enforced expression of defined sets of transcription factors in somatic cells. It remains controversial whether iPSCs are molecularly and functionally equivalent to blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells. By comparing genetically identical mouse ES cells and iPSCs, we show here that their overall messenger RNA and microRNA expression patterns are indistinguishable with the exception of a few transcripts encoded within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster on chromosome 12qF1, which were aberrantly silenced in most of the iPSC clones. Consistent with a developmental role of the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster, these iPSC clones contributed poorly to chimaeras and failed to support the development of entirely iPSC-derived animals ('all-iPSC mice'). In contrast, iPSC clones with normal expression of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster contributed to high-grade chimaeras and generated viable all-iPSC mice. Notably, treatment of an iPSC clone that had silenced Dlk1-Dio3 with a histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated the locus and rescued its ability to support full-term development of all-iPSC mice. Thus, the expression state of a single imprinted gene cluster seems to distinguish most murine iPSCs from ES cells and allows for the prospective identification of iPSC clones that have the full development potential of ES cells."

aS'8q24 amplified segments involve novel fusion genes between NSMCE2 and long noncoding RNAs in acute myelogenous leukemia.\r\nThe pathogenetic roles of 8q24 amplified segments in leukemic cells with double minute chromosomes remain to be verified. Through comprehensive molecular analyses of 8q24 amplicons in leukemic cells from an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient and AML-derived cell line HL60 cells, we identified two novel fusion genes between NSMCE2 and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), namely, PVT1-NSMCE2 and BF104016-NSMCE2. Our study suggests that 8q24 amplicons are associated with the emergence of aberrant chimeric genes between NSMCE2 and oncogenic lncRNAs, and also implicate that the chimeric genes involving lncRNAs potentially possess as-yet-unknown oncogenic functional roles.'

aS'Microarray expression profiling of dysregulated long non-coding RNAs in triple-negative breast cancer.\r\nTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a collection of malignant breast tumors that are often aggressive and have an increased risk of metastasis and relapse. Long non-coding RNAs are generally defined as RNA transcripts measuring 200 nucleotides or longer that do not encode for any protein. During the past decade, increasing evidence has shown that lncRNAs play important roles in oncogenesis and tumor suppression; however, the roles of lncRNAs in TNBC are poorly understood. To address this issue, we used Agilent human lncRNA microarray chips and bioinformatics tools, including Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), to assess lncRNA expression in 3 pairs of TNBC tissues. A dysregulated lncRNA expression profile was identified by microarray and verified by qRT-PCR in 48 pairs of breast cancer subtype tissues. Metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related deaths, including those in TNBC, and the presence of dormant residual disseminated tumor cells (DTC) may be a key factor leading to metastasis. ANKRD30A, a potential target for breast cancer immunotherapy, is currently one of the most used DTC markers. Notably, we found the expression levels of the novel intergenic lncRNA LINC00993 to be associated with the expression levels of ANKRD30A. Furthermore, our qRT-PCR data indicated that the expression of LINC00993 was also associated with the expression of the estrogen receptor. In conclusion, our study identified a set of lncRNAs that were consistently aberrantly expressed in TNBC, and these dysregulated lncRNAs may be involved in the development and/or progression of TNBC.'

aS'Sardinians genetic background explained by runs of homozygosity and genomic regions under positive selection.\r\nThe peculiar position of Sardinia in the Mediterranean sea has rendered its population an interesting biogeographical isolate. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic population structure, as well as to estimate Runs of Homozygosity and regions under positive selection, using about 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 1077 Sardinian individuals. Using four different methods--fixation index, inflation factor, principal component analysis and ancestry estimation--we were able to highlight, as expected for a genetic isolate, the high internal homogeneity of the island. Sardinians showed a higher percentage of genome covered by RoHs&gt;0.5 Mb (F(RoH%0.5)) when compared to peninsular Italians, with the only exception of the area surrounding Alghero. We furthermore identified 9 genomic regions showing signs of positive selection and, we re-captured many previously inferred signals. Other regions harbor novel candidate genes for positive selection, like TMEM252, or regions containing long non coding RNA. With the present study we confirmed the high genetic homogeneity of Sardinia that may be explained by the shared ancestry combined with the action of evolutionary forces.'

aS'Microprocessor mediates transcriptional termination of long noncoding RNA transcripts hosting microRNAs.\r\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a major part in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Mammalian miRNA biogenesis begins with cotranscriptional cleavage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcripts by the Microprocessor complex. Although most miRNAs are located within introns of protein-coding transcripts, a substantial minority of miRNAs originate from long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, for which transcript processing is largely uncharacterized. We show, by detailed characterization of liver-specific lnc-pri-miR-122 and genome-wide analysis in human cell lines, that most lncRNA transcripts containing miRNAs (lnc-pri-miRNAs) do not use the canonical cleavage-and-polyadenylation pathway but instead use Microprocessor cleavage to terminate transcription. Microprocessor inactivation leads to extensive transcriptional readthrough of lnc-pri-miRNA and transcriptional interference with downstream genes. Consequently we define a new RNase III-mediated, polyadenylation-independent mechanism of Pol II transcription termination in mammalian cells.'

aS'Tissue-specific expression of antisense and sense transcripts at the imprinted Gnas locus.\r\nThe mouse Gnas gene encodes an important signal transduction protein, the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, G(s). In humans, partial deficiency of G(s)alpha, the alpha subunit of G(s), results in the hormone-resistance syndrome pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. The mouse Gnas (and the human GNAS1) locus is transcribed from three promoter regions. Transcripts from P1, which encode Nesp55, are derived from the maternal allele only. Transcripts from P2 encode Xlalphas and are derived only from the paternal allele, while transcripts from P3 encode the alpha subunit and are from both parental alleles. The close proximity of reciprocal imprinting suggests the presence of important putative imprinting elements in this region. In this report, we demonstrate that the reciprocal imprinting occurs in normal tissues of interspecific (Mus spretus x C57BL/6) mice. Transcripts from P1 are most abundant in CNS (pons and medulla) in contrast to the more ubiquitous expression from P2 and P3. In the P1-P2 genomic region, we have identified an antisense transcript that starts 2.2 kb upstream of the P2 exon and spans the P1 region. While the P1 transcript is derived from the maternal allele, the P1-antisense (Gnas-as) is derived only from the paternal allele in most but not all tissues. Although both the Nesp55 region and the Gnas-as transcripts are present in cerebral cortex, adrenal, and spleen, Gnas-as is abundant in some tissues in which transcription from the Nesp55 region is negligible. Furthermore, the Nesp55 region transcripts remain strictly imprinted in tissues that lack Gnas-as. Our results suggest that multiple imprinting elements, including the unique Gnas-as, regulate the allelic expression of the Nesp55 region sense transcript.'

aS'[Long noncoding RNAs in gene expression control].\r\nStudies have shown that most of the sequence in the mammalian genome is transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Their crucial roles in gene regulation are becoming a hotspot in current biomedical research. LncRNAs can control gene activities through multiple mechanisms such as: 1) direct or indirect regulation of gene expression via cis-/trans-action or function as protein baits in the nucleus; 2) affecting the stability and the translational process of mRNA; 3) functioning as competitors to regulation of microRNA; 4) binding to transcription factors. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of lncRNAs in development and diseases, and their potentials in future clinical application.'

aS'An imprinted mouse transcript homologous to the human imprinted in Prader-Willi syndrome (IPW) gene.\r\nThe Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by genomic alterations that inactivate imprinted, paternally expressed genes in human chromosome region 15q11-q13. IPW, a paternally expressed gene cloned from this region, is not expressed in individuals with PWS, and is thus a candidate for involvement in this disorder. The IPW transcript does not appear to encode a polypeptide, suggesting that it functions at the level of an RNA. We have now cloned a mouse gene, named Ipw, that has sequence similarity to a part of IPW and is located in the conserved homologous region of mouse chromosome 7. The Ipw cDNA also contains no long open reading frame, is alternatively spliced and contains multiple copies of a 147 bp repeat, arranged in a head-to-tail orientation, that are interrupted by the insertion of an intracisternal A particle sequence. Ipw is expressed predominantly in brain. In an interspecies (M.musculus x M.m.castaneus) F1 hybrid animal, expression of Ipw is limited to the paternal allele. We propose that Ipw is the murine homolog of IPW.'

aS'Intergenic transcription and developmental remodeling of chromatin subdomains in the human beta-globin locus.\r\nGene activation requires chromatin remodeling complexes, which hyperacetylate histones and enable factor access; however, the targeting mechanisms leading to the establishment and maintenance of large, hyperacetylated DNase-sensitive chromatin domains are unknown. Recent work has shown that histone acetyltransferases are associated with RNA-pol II complexes, suggesting that transcription of chromatin plays a role in chromatin modification. Here we show the human beta-globin locus is divided into three differentially activated chromatin subdomains. Large transcripts precisely delineate the active domains at key cell cycle points associated with chromatin transitions and remodeling. We identify an element that initiates these transcripts, located in a region required for chromatin activation. The results suggest that intergenic transcription is required for chromatin remodeling of chromosomal domains.'

aS'The long noncoding RNA RMST interacts with SOX2 to regulate neurogenesis.\r\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the mammalian transcriptome, and many are specifically expressed in the brain. We have identified a group of lncRNAs, including rhabdomyosarcoma 2-associated transcript (RMST), which are indispensable for neurogenesis. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the role of human RMST in modulating neurogenesis. RMST expression is specific to the brain, regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST, and increases during neuronal differentiation, indicating a role in neurogenesis. RMST physically interacts with SOX2, a transcription factor known to regulate neural fate. RMST and SOX2 coregulate a large pool of downstream genes implicated in neurogenesis. Through RNA interference and genome-wide SOX2 binding studies, we found that RMST is required for the binding of SOX2 to promoter regions of neurogenic transcription factors. These results establish the role of RMST as a transcriptional coregulator of SOX2 and a key player in the regulation of neural stem cell fate.'

aS'The role of the oncofetal H19 lncRNA in tumor metastasis: orchestrating the EMT-MET decision.\r\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes are emerging as key players in the metastatic cascade. Current evidence indicate that H19 lncRNA and the microRNA(miRNA) miR-675, which is processed from it, play crucial roles in metastasis, through the regulation of critical events specifically the epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) and the mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET). This review summarizes recent mechanistic pathways and tries to put together seemingly conflicting data from different reports under one proposed general scheme underlying the various roles of H19/miR-675 in the metastatic cascade. We propose several approaches to harnessing this knowledge for translational medicine.'

aS'Demonstration of a multistep mechanism for assembly of the SRP x SRP receptor complex: implications for the catalytic role of SRP RNA.\r\nTwo GTPases in the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor (SR) control the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane. During the protein targeting reaction, the 4.5S SRP RNA accelerates the association between the two GTPases by 400-fold. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate here that formation of a stable SRP x SR complex involves two distinct steps: a fast initial association between SRP and SR to form a GTP-independent early complex and then a GTP-dependent conformational rearrangement to form the stable final complex. We also found that the 4.5S SRP RNA significantly stabilizes the early GTP-independent intermediate. Furthermore, mutational analyses show that there is a strong correlation between the ability of the mutant SRP RNAs to stabilize the early intermediate and their ability to accelerate SRP x SR complex formation. We propose that the SRP RNA, by stabilizing the early intermediate, can give this transient intermediate a longer life time and therefore a higher probability to rearrange to the stable final complex. This provides a coherent model that explains how the 4.5S RNA exerts its catalytic role in SRP x SR complex assembly.'

aS'Long non-coding RNAs as surrogate indicators for chemical stress responses in human-induced pluripotent stem cells.\r\nIn this study, we focused on two biological products as ideal tools for toxicological assessment: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). lncRNAs are an important class of pervasive non-protein-coding transcripts involved in the molecular mechanisms associated with responses to cellular stresses. hiPSCs possess the capabilities of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types, and they are free of the ethical issues associated with human embryonic stem cells. Here, we identified six novel lncRNAs (CDKN2B-AS1, MIR22HG, GABPB1-AS1, FLJ33630, LINC00152, and LINC0541471_v2) that respond to model chemical stresses (cycloheximide, hydrogen peroxide, cadmium, or arsenic) in hiPSCs. Our results indicated that the lncRNAs responded to general and specific chemical stresses. Compared with typical mRNAs such as p53-related mRNAs, the lncRNAs highly and rapidly responded to chemical stresses. We propose that these lncRNAs have the potential to be surrogate indicators of chemical stress responses in hiPSCs.'

aS'Mining Affymetrix microarray data for long non-coding RNAs: altered expression in the nucleus accumbens of heroin abusers.\r\nAlthough recent data suggest that some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exert widespread effects on gene expression and organelle formation, lncRNAs as a group constitute a sizable but poorly characterized fraction of the human transcriptome. We investigated whether some human lncRNA sequences were fortuitously represented on commonly used microarrays, then used this annotation to assess lncRNA expression in human brain. A computational and annotation pipeline was developed to identify lncRNA transcripts represented on Affymetrix U133 arrays. A previously published dataset derived from human nucleus accumbens was then examined for potential lncRNA expression. Twenty-three lncRNAs were determined to be represented on U133 arrays. Of these, dataset analysis revealed that five lncRNAs were consistently detected in samples of human nucleus accumbens. Strikingly, the abundance of these lncRNAs was up-regulated in human heroin abusers compared to matched drug-free control subjects, a finding confirmed by quantitative PCR. This study presents a paradigm for examining existing Affymetrix datasets for the detection and potential regulation of lncRNA expression, including changes associated with human disease. The finding that all detected lncRNAs were up-regulated in heroin abusers is consonant with the proposed role of lncRNAs as mediators of widespread changes in gene expression as occur in drug abuse.'

aS'Long non-coding RNAs era in liver cancer.\r\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies leading to high mortality rates in the general population and the sixth most common cancer worldwide. HCC is characterized by deregulation of multiple genes and signalling pathways. These genetic effects can involve both protein coding genes as well as non-coding RNA genes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nt, constituting a subpopulation of ncRNAs. Their biological effects are not well understood compared to small non-coding RNA (microRNAs), but they have been recently recognized to exert a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression and modulation of signalling pathways. Notably, several studies indicated that lncRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of HCC. Investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying lncRNAs expression opens potential applications in diagnosis and treatment of liver disease. This editorial provides three examples (MALAT-1 metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript, HULC highly upregulated in liver cancer and HOTAIR HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA) of well-known lncRNAs upregulated in HCC, whose mechanisms of action are known, and for which therapeutic applications are delineated. Targeting of lncRNAs using several approaches (siRNA-mediated silencing or changing their secondary structure) offers new possibility to treat HCC.'

aS'Prostate-specific RNA aptamer: promising nucleic acid antibody-like cancer detection.\r\nWe described the selection of a novel nucleic acid antibody-like prostate cancer (PCa) that specifically binds to the single-stranded DNA molecule from a 277-nt fragment that may have been partially paired and bound to the PCA3 RNA conformational structure. PCA3-277 aptamer ligands were obtained, and the best binding molecule, named CG3, was synthesized for validation. Aiming to prove its diagnostic utility, we used an apta-qPCR assay with CG3-aptamer conjugated to magnetic beads to capture PCA3 transcripts, which were amplified 97-fold and 7-fold higher than conventional qPCR in blood and tissue, respectively. Histopathologic analysis of 161 prostate biopsies arranged in a TMA and marked with biotin-labeled CG3-aptamer showed moderate staining in both cytoplasm and nucleus of PCa samples; in contrast, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples presented strong nuclear staining (78% of the cases). No staining was observed in stromal cells. In addition, using an apta-qPCR, we demonstrated that CG3-aptamer specifically recognizes the conformational PCA3-277 molecule and at least three other transcript variants, indicating that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is processed after transcription. We suggest that CG3-aptamer may be a useful PCa diagnostic tool. In addition, this molecule may be used in drug design and drug delivery for PCa therapy.'

aS'RNA gain-of-function in spinocerebellar ataxia type 8.\r\nMicrosatellite expansions cause a number of dominantly-inherited neurological diseases. Expansions in coding-regions cause protein gain-of-function effects, while non-coding expansions produce toxic RNAs that alter RNA splicing activities of MBNL and CELF proteins. Bi-directional expression of the spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCA8) CTG CAG expansion produces CUG expansion RNAs (CUG(exp)) from the ATXN8OS gene and a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein encoded by ATXN8 CAG(exp) transcripts expressed in the opposite direction. Here, we present three lines of evidence that RNA gain-of-function plays a significant role in SCA8: 1) CUG(exp) transcripts accumulate as ribonuclear inclusions that co-localize with MBNL1 in selected neurons in the brain; 2) loss of Mbnl1 enhances motor deficits in SCA8 mice; 3) SCA8 CUG(exp) transcripts trigger splicing changes and increased expression of the CUGBP1-MBNL1 regulated CNS target, GABA-A transporter 4 (GAT4/Gabt4). In vivo optical imaging studies in SCA8 mice confirm that Gabt4 upregulation is associated with the predicted loss of GABAergic inhibition within the granular cell layer. These data demonstrate that CUG(exp) transcripts dysregulate MBNL/CELF regulated pathways in the brain and provide mechanistic insight into the CNS effects of other CUG(exp) disorders. Moreover, our demonstration that relatively short CUG(exp) transcripts cause RNA gain-of-function effects and the growing number of antisense transcripts recently reported in mammalian genomes suggest unrecognized toxic RNAs contribute to the pathophysiology of polyglutamine CAG CTG disorders.'

aS"A homozygous balanced reciprocal translocation suggests LINC00237 as a candidate gene for MOMO (macrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly, and ocular abnormalities) syndrome.\r\nMacrosomia, obesity, macrocephaly, and ocular abnormalities syndrome (MOMO syndrome) has been reported in only four patients to date. In these sporadic cases, no chromosomal or molecular abnormality has been identified thus far. Here, we report on the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings in a child of healthy consanguineous parents suffering from MOMO syndrome. Conventional karyotyping revealed an inherited homozygous balanced reciprocal translocation (16;20)(q21;p11.2). Uniparental disomy testing showed bi-parental inheritance for both derivative chromosomes 16 and 20. The patient's oligonucleotide array-comparative genomic hybridization profile revealed no abnormality. From the homozygous balanced reciprocal translocation (16;20)(q21;p11.2), a positional cloning strategy, designed to narrow 16q21 and 20p11.2 breakpoints, revealed the disruption of a novel gene located at 20p11.23. This gene is now named LINC00237, according to the HUGO (Human Genome Organization) nomenclature. The gene apparently leads to the production of a non-coding RNA. We established that LINC00237 was expressed in lymphocytes of control individuals while normal transcripts were absent in lymphocytes of our MOMO patient. LINC00237 was not ubiquitously expressed in control tissues, but it was notably highly expressed in the brain. Our results suggested autosomal recessive inheritance of MOMO syndrome. LINC00237 could play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome and could provide new insights into hyperphagia-related obesity and intellectual disability."

aS"A noncoding RNA regulates human protease-activated receptor-1 gene during embryogenesis.\r\nActivation of the human protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by thrombin leads to myriad functions essential for maintaining vascular integrity. Upregulation of PAR-1 expression is considered important in atherosclerosis, angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. In vitro analysis of the human PAR-1 promoter function revealed a positive regulatory element between -4.2 and -3.2 kb of the transcription start site. This element was examined in transgenic mice containing either 4.1 or 2.9 kb of the 5' flanking sequence driving a LacZ reporter gene. Only the 4.1 kb PAR-1 transgene was expressed in vivo and only during embryonic development. The transgene expression was observed only in developing arteries and not in veins. Further examination of this putative regulatory sequence identified a novel noncoding RNA (ncR-uPAR:noncoding RNA upstream of the PAR-1) gene at -3.4 kb. The ncR-uPAR upregulated PAR-1-core promoter-driven luciferase activity and mRNA expression in vitro in a Pol II-dependent manner. This noncoding RNA appears to act in trans, albeit locally at the adjacent PAR-1 promoter. These data suggest that an untranslated RNA plays a role in PAR-1 gene expression during embryonic growth."

aS'Melanoma addiction to the long non-coding RNA SAMMSON.\r\nFocal amplifications of chromosome 3p13-3p14 occur in about 10% of melanomas and are associated with a poor prognosis. The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides at the epicentre of this amplicon. However, whether other loci present in this amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the recently annotated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene SAMMSON is consistently co-gained with MITF. In addition, SAMMSON is a target of the lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and its expression is detectable in more than 90% of human melanomas. Whereas exogenous SAMMSON increases the clonogenic potential in trans, SAMMSON knockdown drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells irrespective of their transcriptional cell state and BRAF, NRAS or TP53 mutational status. Moreover, SAMMSON targeting sensitizes melanoma to MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, SAMMSON interacts with p32, a master regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that silencing of the lineage addiction oncogene SAMMSON disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a cancer-cell-specific manner; this silencing is therefore expected to deliver highly effective and tissue-restricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.'

aS"LncRNADisease: a database for long-non-coding RNA-associated diseases.\r\nIn this article, we describe a long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and disease association database (LncRNADisease), which is publicly accessible at http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease. In recent years, a large number of lncRNAs have been identified and increasing evidence shows that lncRNAs play critical roles in various biological processes. Therefore, the dysfunctions of lncRNAs are associated with a wide range of diseases. It thus becomes important to understand lncRNAs' roles in diseases and to identify candidate lncRNAs for disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. For this purpose, a high-quality lncRNA-disease association database would be extremely beneficial. Here, we describe the LncRNADisease database that collected and curated approximately 480 entries of experimentally supported lncRNA-disease associations, including 166 diseases. LncRNADisease also curated 478 entries of lncRNA interacting partners at various molecular levels, including protein, RNA, miRNA and DNA. Moreover, we annotated lncRNA-disease associations with genomic information, sequences, references and species. We normalized the disease name and the type of lncRNA dysfunction and provided a detailed description for each entry. Finally, we developed a bioinformatic method to predict novel lncRNA-disease associations and integrated the method and the predicted associated diseases of 1564 human lncRNAs into the database."

aS'The Notch driven long non-coding RNA repertoire in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\r\nGenetic studies in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have uncovered a remarkable complexity of oncogenic and loss-of-function mutations. Amongst this plethora of genetic changes, NOTCH1 activating mutations stand out as the most frequently occurring genetic defect, identified in more than 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, supporting a role as an essential driver for this gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. In this study, we aimed to establish a comprehensive compendium of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome under control of Notch signaling. For this purpose, we measured the transcriptional response of all protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs upon pharmacological Notch inhibition in the human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CUTLL1 using RNA-sequencing. Similar Notch dependent profiles were established for normal human CD34(+) thymic T-cell progenitors exposed to Notch signaling activity in vivo. In addition, we generated long non-coding RNA expression profiles (array data) from ex vivo isolated Notch active CD34(+) and Notch inactive CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and from a primary cohort of 15 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with known NOTCH1 mutation status. Integration of these expression datasets with publicly available Notch1 ChIP-sequencing data resulted in the identification of long non-coding RNAs directly regulated by Notch activity in normal and malignant T cells. Given the central role of Notch in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis, these data pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target hyperactive Notch signaling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.'
