Downregulation of long noncoding RNA NONHSAT037832 in papillary thyroid carcinoma and its clinical significance.
Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is a kind of RNA that is longer than 200 nucleotides with limited or no protein-coding potential. Studies have proved that lncRNAs play important regulatory roles in gene expression and contribute to oncogenesis and cancer metastasis. However, the expression level of lncRNAs and their clinicopathologic significance in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) have not been well studied. In this study, we investigated the expression level of a novel lncRNA NONHSAT037832 in PTC and paired noncancerous thyroid tissues as well as some cell lines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The association between the expression level of NONHSAT037832 and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with PTC was further analyzed. Three receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) were established to evaluate the diagnostic value of NONHSAT037832. The results suggested that the expression level of NONHSAT037832 was significantly decreased in PTC compared with paired noncancerous tissues (P &lt; 0.01). And, NONHSAT037832 was also significantly downregulated in two PTC cell lines (K1 and IHH-4) compared to normal thyroid follicular epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 (P &lt; 0.01). Downregulated NONHSAT037832 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015) and tumor size (P = 0.032). The ROCs revealed that NONHSAT037832 had a high diagnostic value for differentiating between PTC and noncancerous diseases as well as identifying PTC with lymph node metastasis and larger tumors (≥3 cm). The area under curve was up to 0.897 (95%CI = 0.852-0.942, P = 0.000), 0.641 (95%CI = 0.519-0.762, P = 0.033), and 0.702 (95%CI = 0.567-0.827, P = 0.008), respectively. This study indicated that NONHSAT037832 might serve as a potential biomarker of PTC.
