Genome-wide DNA methylome analysis reveals epigenetically dysregulated non-coding RNAs in human breast cancer.
Despite growing appreciation of the importance of epigenetics in breast cancer, our understanding of epigenetic alterations of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in breast cancer remains limited. Here, we explored the epigenetic patterns of ncRNAs in breast cancers using published sequencing-based methylome data, primarily focusing on the two most commonly studied ncRNA biotypes, long ncRNAs and miRNAs. We observed widely aberrant methylation in the promoters of ncRNAs, and this abnormal methylation was more frequent than that in protein-coding genes. Specifically, intergenic ncRNAs were observed to comprise a majority (51.45% of the lncRNAs and 51.57% of the miRNAs) of the aberrantly methylated ncRNA promoters. Moreover, we summarized five patterns of aberrant ncRNA promoter methylation in the context of genomic CpG islands (CGIs), in which aberrant methylation occurred not only on CGIs, but also in regions flanking CGI and in CGI-lacking promoters. Integration with transcriptional datasets enabled us to determine that the ncRNA promoter methylation events were associated with transcriptional changes. Furthermore, a panel of ncRNAs were identified as biomarkers that discriminated between disease phenotypes. Finally, the potential functions of aberrantly methylated ncRNAs were predicted, suggestiong that ncRNAs and coding genes cooperatively mediate pathway dysregulation during the development and progression of breast cancer.
