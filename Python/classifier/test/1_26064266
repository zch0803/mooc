Expression of lncRNA-CCAT1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in colorectal cancer and its clinical significance.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression and clinical significance of IncRNA-CCAT and EMT related molecule E-cadherin and N-cadherin in colorectal cancer.METHODS: The expression of IncRNA-CCAT1, E-cadherin and N-cadherin in 37 colorectal cancer tissue and para-carcinoma tissue was detected using qRT-PCR method, and the correlation of expression level with clinical and pathological features was studied.RESULTS: The expression of IncRNA-CCAT1 in tumor tissue was significantly higher than that in normal para-carcinoma tissue (P &lt; 0.001), and the expression level of CCAT1was significantly correlated with local infiltration depth (P &lt; 0.001), tumor staging (P &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.001) and CA19-9 level (P &lt; 0.001); but not related with age, gender, location of tumor, tumor differentiation level, size of primary lesion and level of CEA (P &gt; 0.05). The expression of E-cadherin in tumor tissues was significantly lower than in normal para-carcinoma tissues (P &lt; 0.001), and the expression of N-cadherin was significantly higher than that in normal para-carcinoma tissues. The decrease in expression of E-cadherin and increase in expression of N-cadherin were significantly correlated with local infiltration depth (P &lt; 0.001), tumor staging (P &lt; 0.001), vascular invasion (P &lt; 0.001), tumor differentiation level (P &lt; 0.001) and CA19-9 level (P &lt; 0.001), however not related with age, gender, tumor location, size of primary lesion and CEA level (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSION: CCAT1 plays an important role in the genesis, development, invasion and metastasis; it mediates the EMT process of colorectal cancer; and it's expected to be a new marker and treatment target in colorectal diagnosis and treatment.
