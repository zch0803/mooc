Ftx is dispensable for imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in preimplantation mouse embryos.
X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) equalizes gene expression between the sexes by inactivating one of the two X chromosomes in female mammals. Xist has been considered as a major cis-acting factor that inactivates the paternally derived X chromosome (Xp) in preimplantation mouse embryos (imprinted XCI). Ftx has been proposed as a positive regulator of Xist. However, the physiological role of Ftx in female animals has never been studied. We recently reported that Ftx is located in the cis-acting regulatory region of the imprinted XCI and expressed from the inactive Xp, suggesting a role in the imprinted XCI mechanism. Here we examined the effects on imprinted XCI using targeted deletion of Ftx. Disruption of Ftx did not affect the survival of female embryos or expression of Xist and other X-linked genes in the preimplantation female embryos. Our results indicate that Ftx is dispensable for imprinted XCI in preimplantation embryos.
