Long non-coding RNA BANCR regulates growth and metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in retinoblastoma.
Recent evidence shows that BRAF-activated non-coding RNA (BANCR) acts as a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis in malignant melanoma and lung cancer; however, little is known about the significance of lncRNA BANCR in retinoblastoma. The purpose of our study is to explore the role of lncRNA BANCR in retinoblastoma clinical samples and cell lines. The expression of lncRNA BANCR was measured in 60 retinoblastoma samples and normal retina samples by using RT-PCR. The effects of lncRNA BANCR on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were also explored. In our results, lncRNA BANCR is overexpressed in retinoblastoma tissues and cell lines and is associated with tumor size, choroidal invasion, and optic nerve invasion. Moreover, patients with high levels of lncRNA BANCR expression had poorer survival than those with lower levels of lncRNA BANCR expression. Multivariate analysis showed that increased lncRNA BANCR expression was a poor independent prognostic factor for retinoblastoma patients. Furthermore, knocking down lncRNA BANCR expression significantly suppressed the retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. In conclusion, lncRNA BANCR plays a significant role in retinoblastoma aggressiveness and prognosis and may act as a promising target for therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction.
