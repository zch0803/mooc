Increased expression of long noncoding RNA ABHD11-AS1  in gastric cancer and its clinical significance.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in basic physiological processes, also affect tumor occurrence and development. However, there are still many unknown relationships between the lncRNA expression levels and gastric tumor process. In our study, we selected ABHD11 Antisense RNA 1 (ABHD11-AS1) as a representative lncRNAs to study the different expression levels between gastric tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues. At the same time, we analyzed the relationship between the expression levels of ABHD11-AS1 in gastric cancer tissues and the clinicopathological features of patients with gastric cancer and evaluated the diagnostic value through the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve. Results show that compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues the expression level of ABHD11-AS1 in gastric cancer tissues was significantly increased (P = 0.027). The expression level was also significantly related with the differentiation (P = 0.022), Lauren histologic classification (P = 0.004) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (P = 0.007), and the area under ROC curve was up to 0.613. Thus, ABHD11-AS1 might be a potential biomarker for diagnosis of gastric cancer.
