Long noncoding RNA FER1L4 suppresses cancer cell growth by acting as a competing endogenous RNA and regulating PTEN expression.
Aberrantly expressed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with various cancers. However, the roles of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of most cancers are unclear. Here, we report that the lncRNA FER1L4 (fer-1-like family member 4, pseudogene) acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of PTEN (a well-known tumor suppressor gene) by taking up miR-106a-5p in gastric cancer. We observed that FER1L4 was downregulated in gastric cancer and that its level corresponded with that of PTEN mRNA. Both FER1L4 and PTEN mRNA were targets of miR-106a-5p. Further experiments demonstrated that FER1L4 downregulation liberates miR-106a-5p and decreases the abundances of PTEN mRNA and protein. More importantly, FER1L4 downregulation accelerated cell proliferation by promoting the G0/G1 to S phase transition. We conclude that one mechanism by which lncRNAs function in in tumorigenesis is as ceRNAs for tumor suppressor mRNAs.
